            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:94187:4"/> the Glory of God, and the Intereſt of his True Religion Eſtabliſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. And I muſt reckon my ſelf pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly oblig'd to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this by the great Favour of the Divine Providence, in leading me by his Grace, out of an Unhappy Separation, in which I had been E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated, to unite my ſelf to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It has alſo pleas'd the Divine Goodneſs to make ſome Uſe of my mean Endeavours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a Method u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual with his Infinite

            <p>Theſe things have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me on in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour; theſe things have ſupported me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Difficulties and Diſadvantages I have ſometimes encountred.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HAving lately had Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſojourn almoſt Two Years in a</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp.</note> 
               <hi>City of the</hi> Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: <hi>And that ſuch an one as follows and obſerves all the Methods and Practices of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry uſed in that Church, perhaps in as good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and with as much Exactneſs as any other whatever; I had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Opportunity to obſerve ſeveral things of that Nature in common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe there, which are not now com<g ref="char:cross">✚</g>monly known to us in</hi> England.
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:94187:9"/> 
               <hi>This may well be, I think, becauſe 'tis ſome time ſince the Goodneſs of the Divine Providence to us, has happily deliver'd our Church from the Corruptions of</hi> Popery: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>which hates to be Reform'd, has ſince that time carried its Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Diſorders yet further, and to more enormous Degrees: to fulfil the Character of</hi> Evil Men, and Seducers, <hi>who</hi> grow wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e and worſe. <hi>I ſaw too among them a Multitude of things that are a plain and perfect Contradiction to thoſe Plauſible Expoſitions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>which have of late been made uſe of with but too much Succeſs in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Places. This Artifice indeed has been lately very learnedly and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppos'd among us, and the Cheat of it abundantly diſcover'd. But</hi>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:94187:9"/> 
               <hi>after all, thoſe who go abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Places of the</hi> Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <hi>and who ſet themſelves to obſerve what they may, and to examine what they obſerve, cannot chuſe but think there may be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials collected, which may yet be uſed to a further Effect againſt this Deſire; and I wiſh there were no need to do this. I had therefore a Deſign to have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Publick what I had obſerv'd, upon my coming home from that Place, but could hardly have perſwaded my ſelf to do it, becauſe the Obſervations I had made there, were confin'd to one City only. I was therefore glad when I found my ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to go abroad again, hoping that an Opportunity might offer it ſelf to go further, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, or confirm them at leaſt,</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:94187:10"/> 
               <hi>by what I might ſee elſewhere. Things ſucceeded in ſome Meaſure according to my Wiſh; I found I could be ſpar'd from the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I was in, and eaſily obtain'd leave to be abſent for a little while; I reſolv'd to improve my time as well as I could, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my Courſe to ſuch Places within a little Compaſs, as I thought fitteſt to afford me the Matter of ſuch Obſervations as I ſought for. Thus I came to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with the Materials which are here put together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I now reſolve to publiſh them for ſeveral Reaſons, and hope they may be ſerviceable to ſeveral important Purpoſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have indeed (eſpecially the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned Part of the Nation)</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:94187:10"/> 
               <hi>forgotten what the</hi> Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>is in Truth: And there is an Ignorance of this among us, which gives us a great deal of Diſturbance, and which does a great deal of Harm.

And on the other ſide, ſome things both in Doctrine and Practice, are fondly hugg'd and ſtickled for, by the ſame People who make that unreaſonable Out cry, which were brought in with, and do truely belong to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church. Theſe People want to have their Notions rectify'd, and their</hi> Idea <hi>of</hi> Popery <hi>corrected, and made</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:94187:11"/> 
               <hi>more accurate and juſt, by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Repreſentation of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which will give the true Character of it. There are very unhappy Conſequences and Effects of this Miſtake. Some of the Reform'd Churches abroad, who do not know diſtinctly the State of ours, are prejudiced againſt us by the Writings and Reports of theſe fooliſh People, as having a World of the</hi> Popiſh Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>and</hi> Corruption <hi>ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and as being very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious and fond of it: And they cannot think us fit for their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence in order to our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Defence, upon that ſcore. Beſides, the Influence which our Church and Nation might have abroad towards the Defence, and perhaps the propagating and promoting of the Reformation, is</hi>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:94187:11"/> 
               <hi>hereby much abated at leaſt, if I may not ſay 'tis wholly loſt; while ſo many among us apply all their Concern and Endeavour in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balling againſt, and Seeking to undermine and throw down an</hi> Imaginary Popery <hi>in the Church of</hi> England. <hi>That Influence might be very conſiderable, if there were a Concurrence of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towards it, by the Help of our Extenſive Trade, and with the Advantage in reſpect of Learning, which our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities and Clergy have over the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of (if I may not ſay all) the Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>But eſpecially under the Conduct and Management of an Excellent Prince, who has ſo wiſe, and juſt, and ſo great a Zeal for the Honour and Intereſt of the Reformation in General, as his preſent Majeſty</hi>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:94187:12"/> 
               <hi>has, and who has the greateſt Renown and Glory, and the moſt extended Intereſt of any Monarch in the World; whom God grant long to Reign over us, and to have yet more Influence, by his Great Wiſdom, and Glorious Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, among us. It is an Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that amidſt all our Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, eſpecially ſince they have moſt abounded, we ſhould never to any Purpoſe fall upon this, to ſuſpect that the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>and</hi> Romiſh Emiſſaries <hi>do in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe promote our Diviſions on purpoſe to hinder any ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Concurrence amongſt us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have indeed a Zeal againſt</hi> Popery <hi>amongſt us; but as much of it is loſt by a Miſtake in the Object, ſo, I doubt, a great deal</hi>

               <hi>of the reſt in the Wiſe Men of the World, is of leſs Effect and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than it might and ought to be, for want of a due and right Principle. I wiſh it be not their only Concern to ſecure themſelves from the Loſſes they might ſuſtain in their juſt Liberties, and their Properties, if it were impoſed upon them at home; and that they be not too regardleſs what becomes of the Reformation in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts of the World. It ſeems indeed eaſie to ſee (but even Wiſe Men ſometimes look too intently upon one thing) that while the</hi> Proteſtant Religion <hi>is deſtroy'd by degrees abroad, and one Part of the Reformation after another is trodden down, the common Intereſt of it muſt be weaker and weaker, and it muſt be leſs able to ſubſiſt with us at home.</hi>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:94187:13"/> 
               <hi>It is the great Concern of all ſorts of Perſons, on the other ſide, to promote and propagate their own Religion, and to extirpate ours. Among them, 'tis not only the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous Treacheries and Plots of</hi> Jeſuits <hi>that are employ'd in the Work; 'tis not the Wheedles of the other Miſſionary</hi> Monks <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; or the Buſineſs of thoſe who ſeem to make the greateſt Gain of propagating their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but even Princes have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed their utmoſt Power, and have hazarded or loſt, and almoſt ruin'd their Dominions in their Zeal to ſerve their Cauſe: And the greateſt Stateſmen have found time to conſider, and ſerve this, amidſt their moſt Important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. They concern themſelves to extirpate the</hi> Proteſtant Religion <hi>not only out of the Countries which</hi>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:94187:13"/> 
               <hi>they govern, but even out of the World. And what formidable Succeſſes have they had againſt us with their continued Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Endeavours! After o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mighty Havocks made upon the Reformation, we have ſeen them trample upon it in our Time in</hi> Hungary <hi>and</hi> France; <hi>and at this preſent they are making an End with the ſmall Remainders of it in the</hi> Palatinate; <hi>and that by Virtue of Advantages gain'd againſt it by their extraordinary Vigilance and Application to the matter in a late Treaty. They are zealous and induſtrious while We are indifferent. It has been ſeen, that the Wiſe Men on our ſide have been too ſharp for thoſe of the other, in Matters of Trade, while the others have been too hard for them in the Matter of the Intereſt</hi>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:94187:14"/> 
               <hi>of the Reformation; which ſpeaks plainly the Difference of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Concern to the Matter. One would ſuſpect from theſe things, that the Trick of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and Expounding the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Practices of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>had cheated our Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians of the true Notions of</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, <hi>and had made them believe the Differences between that Church and thoſe who are Reformed, to be but ſmall and inconſiderable; and this had betrayed them into Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, and Neglect to watch and oppoſe the Deſigns of</hi> Rome <hi>againſt us: And that it were neceſſary to ſhow even to them, or at leaſt to call to their Remembrance, how Abſurd and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable, how Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and Wicked many of the Doctrines and Practices of that Church are; to be ſure if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

And it muſt needs be wiſh'd, that a more Active and Powerful Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than Men are now commonly guided by, could be found or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned, to ſet them upon a due and juſt Care and Endeavour for the common Defence and Support of the Reformation.</hi>

                  <hi>Antwerp.</hi> We ſet ſail about four a Clock After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and with a good Gale of Wind, which was very fair for us, we came to <hi>Dort</hi> by ſix. There our Skipper lay by, and loiter'd till eight; by which time the Wind was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and we could advance but very ſlowly. Therefore we came to an Anchor, and lay that Night ſomewhat ſhort of <hi>Trenteſas.</hi> This Place we paſs'd by the next Morning, leaving it on our Right-hand, after about an hours ſailing with a Wind not favourable, and but very ſmall. It is a ſmall Village of <hi>Holland,</hi> conſiſting of Fiſhermens and Waggoners Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: It is in the Poſt-Road from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Holland.</hi> They that come from <hi>Brabant</hi> land here from the Boat which they take at <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyck</hi> on the other ſide.

We came nearer afterwards to <hi>Willemſtadt</hi> as we paſs down the Water call'd <hi>Hollands-Deep.</hi> This is a very ſmall City, conſiſting chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of one long Street, which is broad and ſtrait; at the upper end of it ſtands a good large Church, which is all they have or need. The neareſt part of the City is about half a Mile from the Water, but there is a great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal which carries good big Veſſels up into the Town. We ſee from the Water the Walls of this Town, which are encompaſs'd with a good Ditch: The Ramparts are planted with Trees between the Bodies of which appear the tops of

We ſaw a Church and ſomewhat of a Village upon it as we paſſed by, and ſtopt a little way below it within ſight of it. We were in a new Ship that was upon her firſt Voyage, having never been abroad before, and yet ſhe knew her way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as well as the Skipper. For when we had here an Occaſion to upbraid him for his Ignorance, he confeſſed he had been this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſome Years ago in his younger time, but had now almoſt forgot his way. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd true, for he thought it neceſſary to go over a Flat, whereas there was a Channel round it, and the Compaſs was not very large. We ſaw a Ship bigger than ours, and deep loaden, ſail half round us in that Channel, while we were labouring, and likely to have been faſt upon the Flat, tho' the Tide was then almoſt at the higheſt, and we had but few people on Board, and no heavy Lading at all. After the Labour of two hours of more to proceed about the length of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile, and with the help of ſeveral ſtrong Hands of Paſſengers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to thoſe of the Skipper and his Mate, we got into the right Channel.

The Iſlands of <hi>Zeeland,</hi> where they can be plow'd and ſown, bear excellent Wheat, and in great plenty: inſomuch that 'tis ſaid, An Acre of Land here will bear double the Crop of one in <hi>Brabant,</hi> tho' one may alſo ſee very good Crops of Wheat in ſome Places there. The Ground here is very rich, but the Water is not ſweet, nor the Air good, nor have they any Quantity of Wood for Fuel, inſtead of which they burn Turf.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants apply themſelves to the Sea, and trade to all Parts; a multitude of them employ themſelves in Fiſhing, and furniſh their Neighbours with Fiſh: they ſtock the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fiſh-Market at <hi>Antwerp.</hi> Some think, and the <hi>Daeniſh</hi> Hiſtories pretend to it, that the Iſlands of this Province were firſt poſſeſs'd and inhabited by a People out of <hi>Denmark;</hi> where indeed there is an Iſland call'd <hi>Zeeland,</hi> on which ſtands <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and 'tis ſuppoſed the People came from thence, and call'd this new Countrey by the Name of that from whence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94187:20"/> they came. But if this were not ſo, this Name might fitly be given to this Province for the Situation of theſe Iſlands. They have been wont to reckon, that there were Eight wall'd Cities upon theſe Iſlands; one of theſe call'd <hi>Romers-wael,</hi> is now no more; the chief of all is <hi>Middleburg,</hi> which ſtands upon the Iſland <hi>Walcheren,</hi> a City rich, populous, and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Trade to all parts. There were alſo reckon'd formerly upon theſe Iſlands 102 Villages, but many of theſe are gone to wrack by the Sea. They who go about to deſcribe the Province of <hi>Zealand,</hi> commonly ſay, they can hardly pretend to give the preſent State of it, becauſe, perhaps, while they write, the Sea may be making ſome conſiderable Alterations in it: This is a thing which frequently happens; ſometimes the Sea joyns two little Iſlands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by throwing up a Bank of Sand between them; ſometimes it cuts off one part of an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland from the reſt, by throwing a Channel of Water in between them. The People are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to defend the Countrey with high Dykes or Banks of Earth rais'd up; and theſe Banks themſelves need a Defence to keep the Water from waſhing them away; for they being but a looſe Mold, this very eaſily comes to paſs, if the Water can come at them. To prevent which, they make uſe of a Device which will ſeem ſtrange to moſt People in <hi>England,</hi> but which is very frequent here, and on the Banks of many of the great running Waters in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> They take the time of Low-water and lay and faſten upon the Shoar a Mattreſs of Straw, which is two or three Inches thick, which reaches from the loweſt Ebb of Low-Water,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94187:20"/> to the higheſt Riſe of Spring-Tides, and allows ſomething more for the ſwelling of the Water by a ſtrong <hi>Weſt</hi> or <hi>North weſt</hi> Wind, which uſually raiſes the Water conſiderably here.</p>
               <p>Out of the <hi>Voſſemaer</hi> where we lay the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Night, we ſail'd the next Morning, being the 15th of <hi>May,</hi> into the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Channel of the <hi>Schelde,</hi> where we had the Land of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> ſtill on our left ſide, and the Iſland of <hi>South-Bevelandt</hi> on our Right. In this Paſſage we ſail along a Channel which is on both ſides mark'd out by tall Boughs of Trees ſtuck faſt in the Ground, and which ſtand a good height above high-Water; theſe are ſet the length of ſome Leagues, and without them it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find the Channel, which is but nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and has no other Marks about it. On the Right ſide of it is a large Tract. of <hi>South-Bevelandt,</hi> which has been long under Water. It is ſo wide, and the Land beyond it lies ſo low, that one can hardly ſee any Land on that ſide. This Tract contain'd 15 or 16 Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of which nothing now is left; but the Names of them ſtill remain in the Maps in the Places where they ſtood. On this drowned part of this Iſland ſtood the City of <hi>Romers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wael</hi>

In this City (to which it belong'd as a Privilege) the States of <hi>Zee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> met to recognize and ſubmit to a new Count of <hi>Zeeland</hi> in the Year 1549. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter broke in upon this end of the Iſland, and ſeparated that part on which this City ſtood

                  <note place="margin">Bergen-op-Zoom.</note> but at a good Diſtance from it, yet we have ſome Proſpect of the Town and Fortifications, becauſe it ſtands upon a Ground which riſes a little. It is for this Reaſon call'd <hi>Bergen,</hi> from <hi>Berg,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which ſignifies a Hill, and <hi>op-Zoom</hi> for the ſake of a little River which riſes not far above the City in the Countrey of <hi>Brabant,</hi> runs by the City, and ſomewhat below it falls into the <hi>Eaſtern Schelde. Bergen-op-Zoom</hi> is now a Place of ſome Trade, which it could not get while <hi>Antwerp</hi> flouriſh'd: it is under the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the States General, who are at preſent upon a Deſign of improving the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of it. We paſſed by here with a good Wind, and came betimes this Morning to <hi>Lillo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a little Place very ſtrongly fortify'd <note place="margin">Lillo.</note> on the left ſide of the <hi>Schelde,</hi> as one ſails up it, upon the Countrey of <hi>Brabant:</hi> it belongs to the States General of the United Provinces, tho' it be within three Leagues of <hi>Antwerp:</hi> it is always poſſeſs'd by a good Garriſon of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: it was formerly the Seat of a Barony, and belong'd to a Family that were nam'd <hi>Van-dale.</hi> The People of <hi>Antwerp</hi> fortify'd this Place well ſometime before the Year 1534. and put in Garriſon here ſome of their choſen and moſt truſty Citizens to keep it for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their Trade and Navigation. In the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94187:21"/> time of the Rebellion of theſe Countries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government, this Fort was beſieg'd by the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who lay before it for ſome time, loſt 2000 of his Men, ſaw there was no hope of making himſelf Maſter of it, and therefore quitted the Siege. After this, ſome time, it became united to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate States, and they took, and have kept Poſſeſſion of it ever ſince; in which time 'tis grown from a Fort to a little Town. Here we were forc'd to ſtop to be ſearch'd, and to pay a Toll which the <hi>Dutch</hi> here take of all Ships that paſs by. Our Skipper was alſo to have produced a Paſsport, but he had neglected to take one at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and ſo his Ship was ſtopt for that; he had no other way now to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with one, but by ſending to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commiſſary reſiding at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who had Power to grant him one, but he could not tell whether he would do it or not. When we found him under this Confinement and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, we left him, and went on board a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel belonging to <hi>Harlem,</hi> which was loaden with <hi>Rye,</hi> and was bound for <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;</hi> whoſe Skipper undertook to carry us to <hi>Antwerp</hi> for Four Stivers each Perſon. We ſat in the Skipper's Cabbin, which was Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Kitchin and Parlour, and almoſt fill'd with Four Perſons. Here ſat the Skipper's Wife, who kept it very neat and clean; ſhe ſhew'd her ſelf a hearty Friend to our good King, and ſpoke with a great deal of Veneration and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of our late incomparable Queen, and ſo render'd her Converſation very agreeable to us. The Skipper crowded himſelf among us for a little while to eat his Breakfaſt, for here
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94187:22"/> was the Store of Proviſions too, and he ſed heartily upon the Remainders of a Hough of Bacon, generouſly offering us to partake with him. We ſail'd with a good Wind, but now had a ſtrong Tide againſt us. We came up to Fort St. <hi>Mary,</hi> which is, I think, about two Hours above <hi>Lillo,</hi> juſt after Twelve a Clock. This is a Fort which belongs to' the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſtands on the right ſide of the <hi>Schelde</hi> upon the Countrey of <hi>Flanders:</hi> Here alſo we muſt ſtop to be ſearch'd, and to pay a Toll. But the Gates of the Fort were ſhut, according to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and would continue ſo a whole Hour; ſo it was one a Clock before the Officer could come out to us: We were ſoon diſmiſs'd when he came, and ſail'd on to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where we arriv'd in good time in the Afternoon.</p>

               <head>ANTWERP.</head>
               <p>THE firſt Beginnings of this City, as well <note place="margin">Original.</note> as of many others in theſe Parts, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, which is an Evidence that they are very ancient, and had their Beginning while the People were yet ſo barbarous and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as not to mind, or not to be able to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Hiſtory to Poſterity. There is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Tradition ſtill kept up in this City by ſeveral things which relates to ſome of the firſt times of it, which I ſhall take notice of here. They ſay, that about the times of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> there was here a ſtrong Caſtle or Fort which was held by a mighty Giant, to whom ſome give the Name of <hi>Druon,</hi> ſome of <hi>Antigonus;</hi> he was Governour of the People hereabout, and a barbarous Tyrant. He was wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94187:22"/> of all Ships which paſs'd upon the River by this Place, the one half of the Goods which they carry'd, or the Worth of it; and if he found that any endeavour'd to defraud him of any Part of this, which he reckon'd his Due, their Puniſhment was, That he would cut off one of their Hands, and throw it into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. From this Story they derive the Reaſon of the City's Name, making <hi>Antwerp</hi> out of theſe two Words, <hi>Handt</hi> and <hi>Werpen,</hi> which ſignifie <hi>to throw the Hand:</hi> And indeed the true <hi>Dutch</hi> ſpelling of the Name is <hi>Handtwerpen;</hi> We call it <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and the French, <hi>Anvers;</hi> the Latine Name is <hi>Antwerpia.</hi> This Story is commemorated, as I ſaid, in this City ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways. As we enter the City from the River, we ſee over the Gate in Stone-work, a large Image of a Man of a fierce Look, with a great drawn Sword in his Right-hand, and holding in his Left another Hand, as cut off from ſome Perſon. They put alſo in the Arms of this City two Hands, as cut off, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Caſtle. They have alſo a Cuſtom of carrying, in one of their ſolemn Proceſſions once a Year, a certain great Statue of a Man, which is deſign'd to repreſent this Giant, which is follow'd by ſome People who are ſo dreſt, as that they ſeem to have each of them a Hand cut off. This Ceremony we were told, was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e perform'd the next Week following that in which we were there, which would be <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-Week,</hi> according to the New-Stile. It was alſo ſaid it would be more than ordinarily pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous and fine, becauſe it had been omitted for ſome Years during the late War; but our time would not permit us to ſtay to ſee it.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94187:23"/>
               <p>This City is ſeated in a large Plain on the <note place="margin">Situation.</note> Right ſide of the <hi>Schelde,</hi> as it runs towards the Sea, which is here, and ſomewhat upwards, as well as down to <hi>Zeeland,</hi> the Boundary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders. Antwerp</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Sea, if one follows the River, about 17 Leagues; but if one goes the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way by Land, it is but 13. The River is capable of bringing great Ships loaden up to the Wharf of the City. The Tide riſes here perpendicular 12 Feet; the common Depth of the River by the City is about 50 Feet. At a place between <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Lillo,</hi> where, I think, it ſeems no broader than here, it is reckon'd to be 2400 Feet in breadth, and at Low-water it is there 60 Feet in depth. There it was that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> in the time of the Civil Wars, built his Bridge when he came to beſiege <hi>Antwerp.</hi> There is now no Bridge any where hereabout over the River, but Boats and a Ferry-paſs from this City to a Village on the other ſide call'd the <hi>Head of Flanders. Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> was formerly the Head of one of the Four Quarters of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and is ſo ſtill for ſo much as remains of that part under the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> It had under its Juriſdiction the Cities of <hi>Bergen op-Zoom, Breda, Lier, Herentals,</hi> and <hi>Steenberg;</hi> the two former of which, and I believe the laſt are under the Dominion of the States of the United Provinces at preſent; it ſtill retains how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Title of a Marquiſate of the holy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. There are ſtill remaining ſome Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the firſt Wall which was the compaſs of the Caſtle or the Fort foremention'd; which takes in the Church of St. <hi>Walburg</hi> commonly call'd the <hi>Burg</hi>-Church; which was in former
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94187:23"/> times, they ſay, a Heathen Temple. This compaſs is diſtinctly mark'd in the Map of this City. In the Year 1201. there was an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the City begun, and a Wall of a bigger Compaſs made. Again another Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it had, which was begun in the Year 1314. The laſt of all, and that which it has at preſent, was begun in the Year 1543. at which time the City flouriſh'd mightily in Trade, and was in hopes of growing yet greater. A Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of which one ſees carved in the Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work on the out-ſide of one of the Gates, I think it is the <hi>George's-Gate,</hi> where are theſe Words, <hi>Plus ultra,</hi> relating to that matter. And there is a large Compaſs mark'd out among the Gardens adjoyning to the City, which was intended for the next Addition to it.</p>
               <p>The Encreaſes of this City were due to the <note place="margin">Proſperity.</note> great Privileges granted it by the Dukes of <hi>Brabant,</hi> which drew and encouraged a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Trade here, to and from all parts of the World. Several Fairs in a Year were furniſh'd with all manner of Goods that the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of the World could vend. But the greateſt Improvement of its Trade and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, was the making it for a while the common Mart of the Commodities of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> for <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> This Trade began about the Year 1503, and 1504. at which time the <hi>Portugueze</hi> having found out the Navigation round <hi>Africa</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> brought the Riches of thoſe Countries by Sea into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and from thence they were convey'd to this City for the Service of theſe parts of the World. Several Princes had Stock in Trade here, manag'd by Factors appointed by them;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94187:24"/> as the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe Factor was Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham:</hi> He, when he return'd home, built the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> after the Model of the Burſe at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> the Queen her ſelf laying the firſt Stone, and honouring the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that Name. In the Year 1564. it was obſerv'd, that at <hi>Eaſter</hi> there came to the Sacrament at the ſeveral Churches 80600 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. In the Year 1561. 'tis ſaid, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were number'd, and made up between Strangers and Citizens above 200000. It was then uſual to have 25000 Ships lying about this City at a time, and 500 in a day to come and go. Waggons loaden with Goods brought from <hi>Germany, Lorrain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> 2000 in a Week came to this City. And of the Boors and Countrey People there were commonly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd 10000 Carts that came laden every Week with what they could bring to the Markets. Twice a day at certain hours there was wont to be a Concourſe of about 5000 People to the Burſe or Exchange</p>
               <p>Theſe things muſt needs ſeem very ſtrange to thoſe who are acquainted with the preſent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and Silence of this noble City. In the time of the late War, when there were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually many Strangers here that had buſineſs relating to the Armies, it ſeem'd then but very thin of People, in Proportion to its Room and Grandeur, and to have but very little buſineſs; but when we came there now, it was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement to ſee how much more ſolitary it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd. It looks now, methinks, much like one great Cloiſter, where one can neither hear nor ſee any body, almoſt, but at certain Hours at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94187:24"/> the Chappel: Here one ſees no Companies of People, but at the Church, at proper Seaſons. It is really a matter of Wonder, that a place ſo commodious for Habitation and Trade, ſhould be ſo deſerted as it is.</p>
               <p>It is ſituated upon a firm, dry Soil, and ſtands <note place="margin">Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</note> very airy, and well for the Health of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. The Countrey about it is fit for Gardens and Houſes of Pleaſure, where there have been many ſuch belonging to rich Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and there are ſome ſtill remaining. The Countrey affords all things in plenty, that the Earth can yield in our Climate for the Service of Human Life. The noble River brings them great Plenty and Variety of Fiſh. We walk'd on a <hi>Thurſday</hi>-Morning in the Fiſh market, which is worth a Strangers while to do; we ſaw there a great number of large Cod-fiſh freſh, ſome Turbouts ſo big, as it would hardly be believ'd by every body, if we ſhould repreſent it. The Fiſhmongers were cutting out ſome of them to ſell in pieces; the Jowl of one, if we may ſo ſpeak, which was cut off but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Gills, was big enough to fill a good large diſh. There lay ſeveral large Salmons upon the Stalls; this Fiſh they have in plenty here, and reaſonably cheap, and very good. There was not a whole Sturgeon then in the Market, but ſuch are often brought thither. I have been told by thoſe that have ſeen it, of a Sturgeon brought into this Market upon a large Plank, that has been Load enough for half a dozen Men to bring it conveniently. We ſaw three large pieces of one lie there, which had been cut up the day before; they were cut through the Body of the Fiſh, and ſeem'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94187:25"/> bigger than the biggeſt Fillet of Veal that I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw in <hi>London;</hi> They lay ſomewhat in that ſhape. There was a great Quantity of large Plaice, as big as any I ever ſaw at <hi>Tunbridge</hi> or elſewhere, and great plenty of the leſſer ſorts of Fiſhes alive in Water. This River affords Anchovies, which they ſometime dreſs, and eat freſh; they have a very rich high taſte, but it is accounted feveriſh Food. The Fiſh which they chiefly admire, is a large Fiſh about the bigneſs of a Salmon, and of the ſame ſhape, but the fleſh of it is white; this comes often to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and is ſold at the deareſt Rates; they call it here an <hi>Ellebut:</hi> 'tis very firm, and of a rich, pleaſant taſte. The City is furniſh'd with ſmall Wines from <hi>France,</hi> which come down the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and by Sea it can have any of the richer, more generous ſorts of other Countries. They have plenty of Wood for Fuel, and at a reaſonable Rate, which the Countrey affords them by the help of the River. No Place in <hi>Europe</hi> can be better ſtor'd with all things which Gardens can yield for the Service of a Family than this. They have in the Seaſons excellent good Fleſh-Meats of all ſorts. The People are ſome of the moſt generous and ſincere in their Dealings that one can eaſily meet with, yet is this place ſo forſaken. There are on the Ramparts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral large Baſtions planted with rows of tall Lime-trees, which give a wholſome and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Shade. All the reſt of the Ramparts are ſo planted round the City, and in ſome parts they are ſo broad, that they have two broad Walks run parallel upon them, and both of them have on each ſide a Row of tall Trees, which, by mingling their Boughs at the top, make a very
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94187:25"/> pleaſant Arbour which is ſtrait, and of a good length. Theſe Ramparts are rais'd ſo high, that we have from them a good large Proſpect over the adjoyning Countrey; where one ſees a very pleaſant mixture of Corn-fields, Villages, Rows of Trees, Gardens, Meadows and Woods, which lie in the Countrey about. Indeed all the Countrey about looks like a Garden; the Roads and waſte Places are adorn'd with Rows of Trees; and the near Husbandman dreſſes up his Corn-field juſt as if it were a Garden. They make the Ridges very high and broad, and form the Furrows at laſt, when 'tis plow'd and ſown, with a Spade: ſo that the Ridges look like the Beds of a Garden.</p>
               <p>The Compaſs of this City is reckon'd to be <note place="margin">Extent.</note> about 4700 Paces, and if the Plain which leads to the Cittadel, be taken in with that alſo, the whole Compaſs amounts to about 6000 Paces. The <hi>Area</hi> of the whole City is about half of a Circle, the Diameter of which is the River, and the Wall the Circumference. The largeſt Reach of it from ſide to ſide, is along the River, which is reckon'd to be, beginning at the <hi>Slyck-Port</hi> on the <hi>North-ſide,</hi> and ending at the Bridge which goes into the Cittadel on the <hi>South,</hi> 1800 Paces. It is reckon'd to have in it 220 Streets great and ſmall, ſome of them are very long, and ſtraight and broad: the <hi>Mere</hi> is the broadeſt, and is a very ſtately Street. In the broadeſt part of it ſtands upon a large Pedeſtal a great Crucifix, gilded all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to which one ſhall often ſee Devotions paid by thoſe who paſs by. On the left ſide <note place="margin">Burſe.</note> of this is one of the Paſſages on to the Burſe or Exchange, which is near. There are Four
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94187:26"/> ſhort Paſſages into it from other Streets which enter about the middle of the four ſides of it; the <hi>Area</hi> is almoſt ſquare, and ſeems as big as ours at <hi>London,</hi> if not bigger. It has a Piazza round it, which is on the out-ſide ſupported with Marble Pillars: theſe were curiouſly wrought, but the Beauty of them is now much decay'd by Time and Weather. The chief Trade of this City now ſeems to be in Lace, the making of which employs ſome thouſands of People. In the time of its Proſperity was built at the Charge of the City their Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Stadt-Houſe,</hi> which has a large and ſtately <note place="margin">Town-houſe.</note> Front, adorn'd with ſeveral Marble Pillars and Statues, among which, that of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is Eminent and Conſpicuous. This Building ſhews it ſelf upon a very ſpacious open place, which they call <hi>The great Market,</hi> near the Cathedral-Church. There are ſeveral Canals which enter the City out of the River, and riſe and fall with the Tides; the largeſt of theſe is towards the <hi>North</hi>-ſide of the City, which is big enough to entertain a Hundred good Merchants Ships. Near this ſtands a great Building call'd, <hi>The Ooſterling</hi> or <hi>Eaſterling-Houſe;</hi> it ſtands about a large Court; round about it on the out-ſides are ſeveral great Doors for the Entrances of Warehouſes: within the Court below are ſome Rooms for Habitation; and above at the firſt Story there is an open Gallery which goes round the Court, and lets in to the ſeveral large Lodging Rooms. This Houſe was built by Merchants of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Hanſe-Towns of <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors dwelt here together, and kept here their Stores of Goods and Effects. This now begins
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94187:26"/> to decay, tho' there is a Family in it to look after it, and the ſame Towns are ſtill at the Charge to ſupport it, as if they were in hopes that a time might come to uſe it again as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The occaſion of the great Alteration in this <note place="margin">Decay.</note> City is ſaid to be this: In the beginning of the Reformation, when many People were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd for falling in with it in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> they fled many of them hither, thinking to live unobſerv'd in ſuch a great heap and concourſe of People, or to be quiet and ſafe by reaſon of the great Privileges which the City enjoy'd. But theſe People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended and ſpread their Opinions here and in the neighbouring places. This was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and would not be endur'd by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which was then under the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Prince very zealous for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Among other things done with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to prevent the ſpreading of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> their Sovereign, as Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> publiſh'd an Edict about the Year 1565. importing, That all Hereticks ſhould be put to death without Remiſſion; That the Emperor's Edicts, and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould be publiſh'd and obſerv'd, and commanding that the utmoſt Aſſiſtance of the Civil Power ſhould be given to the Inquiſtion. This, and other things which diſguſted the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of theſe Provinces, were done by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and all Orders of this ſort were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly executed by the Duke <hi>D' Alva;</hi> which things put the whole Seventeen Provinces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominion, into a Commotion; it came to a bloody Civil War, and ended in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94187:27"/> the total Defection of the preſent United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces from Subjection to <hi>Spain.</hi> In the times of theſe Troubles many Merchants went away with their Goods and Effects to places where they could be more ſafe and quiet: many, to be undiſturb'd in their Religion, went to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> and to <hi>London,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being now come to the Throne, and ſo the Fall of this City was a means of the Grandeur of thoſe two. It is ſaid, That an Account was taken in thoſe times, and it was found, that at once, within the ſpace of a few days, an hundred thouſand Men had forſaken this and other Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Cities of theſe Provinces, with all that they could carry away with them, to avoid the Rigours and Severities of the Government, and the greater Hazards and Dangers of Loſſes and Miſchief from the Confuſion and Licenſe of the Civil Wars.</p>
               <p>There is no publick Exerciſe or Profeſſion of Religion permitted here, but what is conform'd and ſubject to the Practice and Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Church of this Dioceſe is govern'd by <hi>Johannes Ferdinandus de Berghem,</hi> who is the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and has his dwelling there: He is a very grave and venerable Perſon, exemplary in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and in great Reputation for his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Zeal.

In a fine Chapel dedicated to her in the great Church, and which ſeems more frequented than any other in the Church, there ſtands an Image of a Woman to repreſent her; to the girdle of which is hung a ſmall Gold Key, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Key of the City Gates. But the bad Huſwife has prov'd ſo unfit to keep the City, that ſhe has often loſt the Key of it. There was a Report ſhe had loſt her Key in one Night in the Year 1696. but I ſaw within a little while after that ſhe was honour'd with another for all that. Certainly this preſenting her with a Key of their City has ſome further meaning than only to expect the Protection of Almighty God through her Interceſſion; and looks very like, at leaſt, to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves to her immediate Protection. As one goes out at St <hi>George's-Gate,</hi> under the Paſſage, there ſtands an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> with ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Verſes under it, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h ſignifie as follows:
<q>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94187:28"/>All honeſt and ſincere Catholicks, Honour ye <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of our Lord: ſhow to her great Love; that ye may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved both in going out, and coming in: From all Pain and ſudden Death. He ſhall never travel unfortunately, who calls upon her in the time of his neceſſity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here is no intimation in the leaſt of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, but the People are directed to call upon her for their Safety, and to honour her, that they may obtain it. In the great Church there hand up ſeveral printed Litanies of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as they are call'd, which People are encourag'd to ſay over there upon their Knees before an Image of the Virgin, by the Grants of Indulgences to them that ſhall do ſo. In theſe Litanies 'tis uſual to repeat fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently theſe Words, <hi>Have Mercy upon us,</hi> as addreſs'd to her. They ſay to her, <hi>From all Evil and Danger, and from all Sin, deliver us, O glorious Virgin.</hi> And, <hi>That it may pleaſe thee to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, and preſerve, and encreaſe the Congregations and Aſſemblies, which by a particular Dvotion and Servitude are devoted to thee; we humbly beſeech thee to hear us. That it may pleaſe thee to keep our Hearts and Minds in all Chaſtity, and Purity, and Piety, we humbly beſeech thee to hear us.</hi> Theſe and many other like things, in the common and allow'd Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do plainly ſignifie, That they ask, and expect Help from the ſaints themſelves. Tho' 'tis pretended by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> that they ask of God only, for their ſakes, and hope to obtain of God by their Interceſſion what they deſire. And the <hi>Mechlin</hi> Catechiſm as well as their common Practice does palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94187:28"/> contradict this Pretence. The 7th. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the 18th. Leſſon therein, is, <hi>What Help or Aſſiſtance may we expect from the Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin?</hi> It is to be obſerv'd here, the Queſtion does not ſay <hi>by</hi> the Holy Virgin, or <hi>by her Interceſſion,</hi> but <hi>from</hi> the H. Virgin. And the Anſwer ſays and teaches the People, That <hi>ſhe helps us in all that is profitable to us, and eſpecially in our laſt Hours: ſhe ſtrengthens the Weak, ſhe comforts the Sick, ſhe keeps off Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and ſhe helps us to everlaſting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Images of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> are very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Images.</note> to be ſeen about the Streets of this City: ſometimes we ſee them over the Doors of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houſes on the out-ſide; and there are very few, I believe, that have not one at leaſt, within. They are very common at the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Streets, and over the Doors of thoſe call'd <hi>Religious Houſes.</hi> Theſe Images are often honour'd with a Crown on the Head, and a Sceptre in the Hand; and ſometimes on each ſide an Angel is ſet upon his Knees with Hands lifted up together in the Poſture of praying to her. Men and Women as they paſs by theſe Images, commonly pay their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to them in their ſeveral ways. I have ſeen a Child of four or five years old, as it has been running careleſly by an Image of the Virgin, which was far above it, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, has been ſtopp'd by the Parents and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to look up, and make a reverend Courteſie to the Stone, and ſay, <hi>Good Mother.</hi> All the publick Lanthorns of the City, and commonly thoſe in the Portals of private Houſes, are hung up before an Image of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94187:29"/> Virgin, and 'tis an Honour paid to her to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a Candle to burn before the Image. I have ſeen an Image of her over a private Houſe, in the Arms of which was conſtantly laid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the beſt that the Earth affords in its Seaſon; and have ſeen ſome of the firſt of ſome ſorts of Flowers, the firſt ripe Cherries, and the like, preſented to her; which is an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage eternally due to Almighty God, but to none elſe. Theſe Practices ſuit with what they call her in their Litanies, that is, <hi>Queen of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> and <hi>Queen of Heaven and Earth.</hi> In moſt Shops of the City is an Image of the Virgin, and when Evening comes, it is the Cuſtom to light a Candle and ſet it up before that; which is juſt as the Heathens were wont to honour the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of their Houſhold-Gods. And indeed the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, with a great deal of Guilt, has in many things reviv'd the old Corruptions of Religion, which the Heathens fell into, as will be further obſerv'd in the Sequel of this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Images of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> are alſo commonly ſet over the publick Pumps in this City: over that in the Fiſh-Market is one, which was conſecrated a few Years ago in the Jeſuits Chapel, and brought in a ſolemn and pompous Proceſſion by the Jeſuits, to be ſet up in this place. Under the Feet of the Woman are theſe Words of Scripture applied to her; <hi>A Well of Living Water:</hi> and another <hi>Dutch</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription calls her, <hi>Mary of good Succeſs.</hi> There is alſo, as I remember, at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which is call'd <hi>Maria Pacis:</hi> We met alſo in this Journey with another I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, of which more will be ſaid hereafter, which is call'd <hi>Notre Dame de Pierre,</hi> or our
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94187:29"/> Lady of the Stone; where People go to pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> when they are afflicted with Stone or Gravel. Thoſe who have travell'd further than we, know, that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of the like nature uſual in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church. But theſe things are put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here, as what do evidently betray the true Notion of the Papiſts concerning the Images of the Saints through all the Diſguiſes and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Repreſentations which they put upon their Uſe of them. The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> after the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> would have it thought they do not believe there is any Virtue in their Images, or that any Truſt is to be put in them. The Heathens believ'd, that when an Image was made and conſecrated to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any of their Gods, this was, as it were, a Symbol of the preſence of that Deity where ever it was put: they believ'd the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Power of that Deity in and with that Image, and to be, as it were, bound to it ſo as to be exerciſed there, and to be removed with it. And the common Practice of the Papiſts evidently declares they have the ſame Opinion of their Images: what other account can be given of their going to one Image of the ſame Saint for one Benefit, and to another for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? They pretend to obtain good Succeſs at one of theſe Images, Peace at another, and Cure of the Stone at another. Their very Form of conſecrating their Images, ſhows they expect the Virtue of the Saint ſhall attend the Image. In an old Pontifical which <hi>Chemnitius</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divine of <hi>Germany</hi> had, and which he mentions in his <hi>Examen</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> he found this Form of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94187:30"/> an Image of the Bleſſed Virgin:
<q>Sanctifie, O God, this Form of the Bleſſed Virgin, that it may bring ſalutary Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to they Faithful People; That Thunders and hurtful Lightnings may be drove away; That Inundations of Waters, Commotions of Civil Wars, or Invaſions, and Devaſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Heathen Nations may be ſtopp'd and ſuppreſs'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, there is ſince that time a new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Pontifical overſeen and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. which he enjoyned to be every where uſed, and at the ſame time he ſuppreſs'd and forbid the Uſe of any other; and this by an Act dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 10th. 1596. In this new one the Prayer for bleſſing or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating ſuch an Image, is ſomewhat alter'd in Words, but it evidently and fully expreſſes this Opinion of their Images. In one <hi>Antiphon</hi> in the Office for that purpoſe they ſpeak thus:
<q>We betake our ſelves to thy Protection, O Holy Mother of God, deſpiſe not our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations in our Neceſſities, but free us from all Danger always, O Glorious and Bleſſed Virgin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And, while the Company are ſinging this, the Biſhop who conſecrates, Incenſes the Image three times. The concluding Prayer in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſpeaks home to the purpoſe in theſe Words:
<q>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:94187:30"/>
                     <hi>Almighty Eternal God, by whoſe moſt gracious Diſpenſation all things were created out of nothing; vouchſafe, we beſeech thee, to bleſs</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> [Here he makes a Croſs over the Image] <hi>and ſanctifie <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> this Image, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently prepar'd and fitted in Honour of the Mother of thy bleſſed Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; And grant, O moſt merciful Father, by the Invocation of thy Holy Name, and of the ſame thy only begotten Son our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue Chriſt (who for the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the Integrity of the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>being preſerved, thou waſt willing ſhould be Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate) through the Prayers of the ſame moſt H. Virgin, that whoſoever ſhall ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves humbly to honour the ſame Queen of Mercy, and our moſt gracious Lady before this Effigies, may be delivered out of any imminent Dangers, and may obtain in thy ſight the Pardon of any Sins they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and may merit for the preſent to obtain that Grace or Favour which they deſire, and may hereafter rejoyce with thine Elect in everlaſting Salvation, by the ſame our Lord Jeſus Chriſt thy Son, who with thee in the Unity of the Holy Spirit liveth and reigneth one God world without end.</hi> Amen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here we ſee plainly, that they do expect in general the removing of all Evil, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of all Good by praying before ſuch a conſecrated Image; which ſignifies that they expect to find here the preſence of the Deity repreſented by the Image, and that this God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs will here exert her Power to their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94187:31"/> according to the Notions and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Heathen. A further Specimen of their Practice agreeable to this Repreſentation of it, we had in the Year 1696. which they were not aſham'd to publiſh to the World in the common Intelligences. A certain Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in greater Eſteem than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for the Feats done, as the People may think, by it, was brought into the Chamber of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he being at that time indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, this was in order to obtain of the Virgin the Cure of his Diſtemper. Some time after he recover'd, as how could it be otherwiſe, and upon his firſt going abroad, he return'd the Viſit this Image had made him, and went to that to give his Thanks there for his Recovery. It is an uſual thing among them for the Prieſts to tell the People concerning ſome Images of the Virgin on the Sea-coaſts, That after a ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Night, the Petticoats on the Image ſhall be ſoundly dabbl'd; which, they ſay, is occaſion'd by her having been abroad that Night buſie at the Aſſiſtance of Mariners that call'd upon her in their Diſtreſs: Do they then teach the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that there is a Preſence of the Deity or Saint with the Image to help them or not? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when they make long Pilgrimages to one Image of a Saint, and pay extraordinary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions there, and paſs by, perhaps, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Images of the ſame Saint in their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with a common Salutation, is not this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe the Preſence of the Saint to be more with one Image than another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they expect rather to meet with the Virtue of the Saint there, and put ſome Truſt in that Image more than in another?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94187:31"/> We met with many of theſe fooliſh and idle People called <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> in our Journey, between <note place="margin">Pilgrims.</note> 
                  <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Louvaine,</hi> and between that and <hi>Maeſtricht;</hi> and again, between <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>Duſſeldorp.</hi> They were commonly in Troops, ſometimes near Twenty together, and many of them young Fellows and Wenches that ſeem'd to be got together from their Friends and Relations for ſome other purpoſes than Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>There are Five Pariſh Churches in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Pariſh-Churches.</note> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and a great number of the Chapels of thoſe call'd Religious Orders. The Clergy who poſſeſs the Pariſh Churches, and ſerve the Worſhip there, are call'd Secular Prieſts, while the Monks and Friers are call'd Regular ones, and Religious; as if they who are ſuch according to the Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, were Men of the common World, and only of humane Inſtitution; but theſe who are truly a ſort of meerly humane Invention, were the only ones that were ſet up according to Rule. But it is to be obſerved for the better Explanation of this matter, that the Monks do, when they ſpeak out, acknowledge themſelves Regulars, according to a Rule of humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; for ſome are ſaid to follow the Rule of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> ſome the Rule of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> ſome the Rule of the ſpecial St. <hi>Ignatius Loyola.</hi> According to Truth therefore the Names ought to be chang'd to remove the Abuſe of them, and the Regulars ſhould be call'd Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and the Seculars, Regular. The Monks and Friars are known by the Habit of their Order; the Prieſts of the Pariſh Churches have commonly one Garb all over theſe Countries,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94187:32"/> which is a black Cloak and a little Band.</p>
               <p>The oldeſt and the meaneſt of the Pariſh-Churches is that dedicated to St. <hi>Walburg,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd before, which was the firſt Church of the City; and in times of Heatheniſm, they ſay it was a Temple dedicated to <hi>Mars.</hi> The high Altar here has over it a good piece of Painting done by <hi>Rubens,</hi> which repreſents our Saviour as taking down from the Croſs. There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome other very good Pieces of Painting in that part of the Church, to which one aſcends by a great many Steps from the reſt of the Church.</p>
               <p>Near that call'd the <hi>George's Gate</hi> ſtands ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, which is dedicated to St. <hi>George,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">St. George.</note> who is eſteem'd by the Popiſh Church the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and Protector of <hi>England.</hi> For as the Heathens had their Gods of Nations and Cities, ſo the Papiſts have their Saints for the ſame purpoſes. As for this St. <hi>George,</hi> 'tis certain that no ancient Hiſtory of the Church makes any mention of him: and 'tis very likely he came to be in Repute for Worſhip juſt as a great many other of the <hi>Roman</hi> Saints have done: That is, ſome Monk or other pretends to have a Viſion in which ſuch a Perſon appear'd to him, and told him he was formerly ſuch an one, and that they muſt for their Aſſiſtance in ſome real or pretended Diſtreſs, ſet up a Method of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to him. Such as this is all the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which they have for the Worſhip of many of their pretended Saints. Are they not then herein liable to our Saviour's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that they worſhip they know not what? It is very probable there never was in the World any ſuch Perſon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94187:32"/> as this St. <hi>George:</hi> They know not at what time to ſet him; ſome aſſign him the Third Century, and ſme the Fourth. They agree indeed to have him a Martyr under <hi>Diocleſian:</hi> They generally confeſs, that the Acts of his Martyrdom are loſt, and they know no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Circumſtances concerning it. <hi>Baronius</hi> believes that the common manner of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him, which is as ſitting upon a Horſe, and piercing a Dragon under his Horſe's Feet with a Spear, and having a Woman ſtanding behind him in the Poſture of a Supplicant, does not deſign a true Story; for he could not find any the leaſt Footſtep of ſuch a thing in ancient Hiſtory; therefore he would have this a ſymbolical Repreſentation, and deſign'd to expreſs the Univerſal Devotion of the Church, which implores the Aſſiſtance of this Saint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Attacks of its Enemies. This Church of St. <hi>George</hi> is not very fine, nor, I believe, much frequented. They are in want of a fine Thing in which they expoſe their <hi>Hoſtie</hi> to the View of the People, when 'tis only to be ſeen and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd, which from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Word I ſhall call a <hi>Remonſtranter;</hi> therefore a ſtrong Box is ſet <note place="margin">Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranter.</note> upon a Poſt in the Church, with a Hole to put Money in at, and an Inſcription by it, ſays, <hi>Here the Offerings are put that are deſign'd for a new Remonſtranter.</hi> It is a thing with a Foot like a Chalice, upon which it can ſtand; from a Stem which goes up a little, from that there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends a fine flouriſh'd Work which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Foot or a Foot and half deep, and of a proportionable Breadth. In the middle of this between two Oval or Round Chryſtals, is put an <hi>Hoſtie,</hi> that is, the white Wafer which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94187:33"/> they uſe in the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. It is ſet upon its edge, and can be ſeen on both ſides of the thing: in ſuch a thing as this they always carry the <hi>Hoſtie</hi> in Proceſſions; and the matter of theſe things is uſually Silver, and ſometimes gilded with Gold, and perhaps ſet with precious Stones, and hung with little Silver Bells. When they carry the Sacrament to the Sick, they have it in a Chalice, and do not ſhow it. In the Year 1695. in the Yard belonging to this Church there was erected an Imitation of Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> which ſeems to <note place="margin">Mount Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary.</note> grow much in eſteem and to be well frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as one ſees the neweſt things commonly moſt valued in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> new Saints, new Altars, new Indulgences, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pretence to Antiquity in all they do, and to value themſelves and their Fopperies for that. There is a little Mount raiſed with Turfs, which riſes gradually from the Level to the height of above 7 or 8 Feet at the upper end. There is ſet a Crucifix which was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated upon the ſpot. The Croſs, as yet, is painted only with a plain red Colour, and the Body with white, but in time both may come to be finer; for the Trick takes and gathers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. It ſtood naked for ſome time, but with a ſtrong Box upon a Poſt at the Foot of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent to receive Money; and after a time Benches were ſet upon the Hill for People to kneel upon; then two Pictures upon boards cut to the Shape of them, were ſet at the Foot of the Croſs, the one repreſenting the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the other St. <hi>John;</hi> and now it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd with a Plantation of Trees, and the Mount is ſurrounded with a good quick-ſet
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94187:33"/> Hedge. People are often ſeen praying there at all hours of the Day; ſome upon the Ground, ſome kneeling on the Benches; ſometimes as they kneel before the Crucifix, they ſtretch out their Hands, and hang down their Heads, and ſo remain ſome time in that Poſture, imitating that of the Body on the Croſs. Without doubt they are excellent Followers of our Saviour herein. Sometimes a Queaſil or devout Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that has a great Opinion of her own San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, thruſts her ſelf among the great Folks at the Foot of the Croſs, and kneels there at her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions: ſometimes one ſhall ſee People creeping round the Croſs upon their Knees, and dropping their Beads as they go, to perform, 'tis likely, ſome voluntary or enjoin'd Task of Devotion.</p>
               <p>Having mention'd Queaſils, I muſt ſay what <note place="margin">Queaſils.</note> they are. I think the Name is given in theſe Countries only to Women; it ſignifies a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Perſon: there are Multitudes of them in this City; they are particularly devoted to ſome Saint, or to ſome Religious Order; they bind themſelves to ſome particular Tasks of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that Saint, and belong to a Religious Fraternity, of which more will be ſaid here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: ſome therefore belong to the Pariſh-Churches where are the Chappels which they frequent; and ſome belong to the Religious Orders, ſo that ſome of them are call'd the Jeſuits Queaſils; and it was ſaid, There is one Jeſuit in the Houſe at <hi>Antwerp</hi> that had made Threeſcore Queaſils; ſome again are call'd <hi>Minorite Queaſils,</hi> &amp;c. They ſay they wear ſome Garment under their outermoſt Cloaths, which is in the Shape of the Habit of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they belong to: 'tis ſuppos'd the Monks
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94187:34"/> to whom they belong, and who are their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors look to it that they do ſo; for this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, they oblige themſelves to do. They do not ſolemnly vow a ſingle Life, as Nuns do, but they pretend to purpoſe it; ſo that tho' ſome of them do marry, 'tis rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd ſcandalous to do ſo, and is very ſeldom done. They live about in the City in their own Houſes, and are in Trades; ſome of them are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant-Maids. They pay all their Devotionsin the Chappels of the Order they belong to ordinarily. They make frequent Preſents to that Order, and ſometimes conſiderable ones at their Death; which makes the Jeſuits induſtriouſly wheedle to themſelves the richeſt. One of their Quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils died a few Years ago, and left them a good Eſtate near the City, with a noble Seat upon it, about which are all the Pleaſures of Gardens; this is their Countrey-houſe, to and from which one ſhall often ſee them paſſing. Their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Habit is Black, with a broad Cambrick Band round their Shoulders, and a black Peak on their Forehead, ſo that they are dreſs'd as in Mourning, and as Widows.</p>
               <p>The Church of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> is another of the five Parochial ones. It is a handſom Church, has the Altars rich and well adorn'd on high Days. In the Windows there is ſome Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it ſeems to be ſome of the beſt of the kind I ever ſaw, tho' I have ſeen thoſe at <hi>Goude</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another of the Parochial Churches, and one of the fineſt in the City, is that of St. <hi>James,</hi> ſtanding between the <hi>Kip-dorp-ſtreet,</hi> and the long new Street. It is a very lofty and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Building. There is a Beginning of a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94187:34"/> Steeple already advanc'd to a good height, and deſign'd to have been much higher, but the Deſign and Work has been laid aſide for ſome time. It is a Collegiate Church, and is built in the Form of a Cathedral. Over the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Door on the outſide, one may read theſe Words; which are ſet under an Image of St. <hi>James; Apoſtolus Divus Jacobus Major, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus hujus Patronus.</hi> Over the Portal, which is ſupported with vaſt Marble Pillars, there are theſe Words in Golden Letters written, <hi>Divo Jacobo ſacrum.</hi> Certainly theſe Words ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſomething more than that they only apply to St. <hi>James</hi> for the Aſſiſtance of his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with the ſame Spirit of Charity with which we deſire our Friends on Earth to pray for us; which is the Interpretation that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> puts upon their Invocations of the Saints. The Erecting and Dedicating a Church to the Honour of a Saint, wherein he is to be invocated and applied to with Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Worſhip, does not certainly look ſo much like an Exerciſe of Charity, as of Devotion. The Heathens thought this a Divine Honour, and ſuch, without doubt, the People of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> take it to be. Certainly none of us pay an Honour like this to any the beſt of our Friends on Earth, when we deſire to be remembred in their Prayers. In this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription the Saint is mention'd alone, as if the Church were intirely dedicated to him. Sometimes in an Inſcription over the Door of a Church, or over an Altar, they have ſo much the Remembrance of Almighty God as to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion him together with the Saint; as at a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Jeſuits in their Countrey-houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovemention'd,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94187:35"/> near <hi>Antwerp,</hi> there are theſe Words over the Door; <hi>Deo O. M. &amp; Sancto Ignatio ſacrum.</hi> But whether the Invocation of the Saints in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be done with the Spirit of Charity or Devotion, and whether the Honours paid them are divine or not, will beſt appear by a true Repreſentation of their Practice in ſuch Particulars as I have obſerv'd and ſeen, and by the Devotions which attend the Feſtivals of the Saints. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe I ſhall give from themſelves in ſome Inſtances, as I have learnt them by the following means. They have ſo many Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> obſerv'd by ſome or other among them, that they find it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to publiſh and give notice of them ſome Days before by printed Papers poſted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Cities, which are chiefly ſet at the Doors of Churches or Religious Houſes. And theſe, like our Play-houſe-Bills, give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what Devotions are to be perform'd on thoſe Days, and what Indulgences are granted to encourage them, and where theſe are to be obtain'd. Having had the Curioſity to collect a number of theſe Papers, I ſhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and inſert ſome of them in proper places in this Relation. Since we are now at St. <hi>James</hi>'s Church, I ſhall inſert here the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Feſtival, as it is celebrated in this Church; which is as follows:</p>

                     <p>Upon the 25th of this Month, being the Feaſt-day of the holy and glorious Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> hath our Holy Father <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> granted a Plenary Indulgence (beginning from the firſt <hi>Veſpers,</hi> that is, at the <hi>Veſpers</hi> of the day before) to all faithful Chriſtians, who, with ſincere Repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confeſs'd, and having receiv'd the holy Sacrament of the Altar, ſhall upon the Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of the H.

                     <p>To this end, in the Morning before Mattins ſhall the holy Sacrament of the Altar be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in the hig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>At Eight a Clock ſhall be preached the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Sermon by the Reverend the Pleban and Canon of the ſame Church. At Nine a Clock a very ſolemn Maſs in Muſick ſhall be perform'd: At half an hour after Ten ſhall the Sermon be preach'd; after which at half an hour after Eleven there ſhall be a ſolemn Maſs in Muſick provided by the Captain of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> of this City.

                     <p>Laſtly, it is deſir'd of the good People and Pariſhioners of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, that they would earneſtly pray through the Interceſſion of their Patron, that they may alſo be preſerv'd from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94187:36"/> violent and haſty Sickneſſes and all Misfortunes.</p>

               </floatingText>
               <p>All this is to be done in Honour of this Saint, and to obtain his Interceſſion; and the People are encourag'd by the Pope himſelf to attend theſe Devotions by a Plenary Indulgence. Is this to be parallel'd then with our deſiring our Friends on Earth to pray for us? Has the Saint ſo little Charity, and is he ſo backward to intercede, that without all this ado he will not open his Mouth for them? This is much that is to be done on this Occaſion, and yet is little to what is done to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who has a great many Feſtivals in a Year, and they attended with whole <hi>Octaves,</hi> on which particular and extraordinary Devotions are paid to her. The true meaning of all, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this: Mankind has been always taught, and have believ'd the neceſſity of a Mediator, and that a Divine Perſon muſt be our Mediator, and Divine Honours are due, and may be paid to whomſoever is ſo; ſince this appears in the whole Theology of the Heathens, and is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Truths which are taught us in the Goſpel, we have reaſon to believe they deriv'd this Knowledge from the Fathers of the World by Tradition, to whom it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd by God himſelf. But the Heathens, having only Tradition to guide them, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Doctrine by bringing in a Multitude of Mediators; whereas the Goſpel, according to the truth of the matter, teaches us, that there is but one Mediator between God and Man, and that is Chriſt Jeſus. This Corruption is reviv'd in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who has many Mediators, and adores them all, and pays them
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94187:36"/> Divine Honours, as the Heathens did. More of this we ſhall ſee in the following Relation.</p>
               <p>Over the high Altar in this Church of St. <hi>James,</hi> in the Quire, is a very coſtly, large and beautiful piece of Architecture all of Marble. The Pillars on the ſides are ſome of them white Marble, ſome black, the white wreath'd, theblack ſmooth and ſtrait, and they are intermix'd with curious Art; the whole is certainly a Work ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry admirable. Inſtead of a Picture for an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-piece, there is an Image of St. <hi>James</hi> big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the common Size of Men, which is of white Marble. He is repreſented as looking upwards, and pointing downwards to the People below. Over his Head in the Arch of the Marble-work about him, and towards which he directs his Face, there is carv'd the impious and idolatrous Repreſentation of the holy Trinity, which is very common in the Churches of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion. There is <note place="margin">Image of the Holy Trinity.</note> the Figure of an Old Man ſitting in the Clouds, with a Triple Crown on his Head, and of a Young Man by him, holding a Croſs with one Hand; and between them both is a Pidgeon hovering with his Wings ſpread, and Rays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. I do not doubt but it is lawful to repreſent the humane Body of Jeſus Chriſt our bleſſed Saviour, in any of the Circumſtances of his Life or Death on Earth, either by Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures or by Images. But certainly, as it is the Glory of the Divine Nature to be inviſible in it ſelf, ſo it ought not to be repreſented by any viſible thing. God himſelf adds an expreſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of making any viſible Repreſentation of himſelf, as an Explication of the ſecond Commandment. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> judges
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94187:37"/> it an impious profanation to do ſo, and calls it a Changing the Glory of the inviſible God into the meanneſs of that thing which the Image made to repreſent him, does more truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. He ſays therefore of the Heathens <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1.) that while they made the Images of of Men or Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to repreſent the Deity by, they chang'd the Glory of God into an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What does the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this caſe differ from theirs? 'Tis true, the Goſpel tells us, when Jeſus was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized and came out of the Water, the Spirit of God did with a viſible Repreſentation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon him, whereby the Man Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Chriſt of God. A viſible Glory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended like the hovering of a Dove, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, to be a ſenſible Token and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to the Spectators, that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed by the Holy Ghoſt, and was to be reckon'd by them the true Meſſiah or Chriſt. But this does not at all allow or conclude for the repreſenting the holy infinite Spirit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a Pidgeon. The <hi>Shechinah</hi> or Pillar of a Glory in the Wilderneſs, was a Token of God's ſpecial preſence among the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> there, but was not a fit Repreſentation of the infinitely glorious God himſelf; nor was it deſign'd to be ſo, but only for a ſenſible To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and Aſſurance of a peculiar divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when preſs'd with things of this Nature, endeavours to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Argument by blaming the Liberty of Carvers and Painters; but there is no room at all to do it in this caſe. For this is a thing done by publick Allowance, and encourag'd by the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94187:37"/> Authority of the Church, as we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd in the Sequel of this Relation. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhall add to this purpoſe what is further to be obſerv'd in this ſame Church. In the paſſage round the Quire, on the outſide, where are ſeveral very neat Chapels to particular Saints, enclos'd with partitions of Marble Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars or Rails; there is ſet up againſt the Wall in a Frame a printed Repreſentation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Trinity, contriv'd after the ſame manner with the former, and under it there is print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Dutch</hi> this Grant; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay here Five Pater Noſters, and Five Ave-Marys, ſhall enjoy Forty Days Indulgence; this granted by the Biſhop of</hi> Antwerp. The Quire is part of it compaſs'd with beautiful Marble-pillars: there is a great deal of good Painting, and abundance of Marble about the whole Church.</p>
               <p>In this Church by the entrance of the <hi>North</hi> Door on the Left-hand, is a large Chappel which they call <hi>The Chappel of the Dead.</hi> The Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece repreſents our Saviour as dead, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king down from the Croſs, and lying in the Lap of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who ſits in a very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful poſture contemplating upon the matter. On the out-ſide of the partition upon a pillar, there hangs in a Frame, written in <hi>Dutch,</hi> a new Grant in Favour of this Chapel. It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, That all thoſe of the Brotherhood of the Dead, who ſhall come to hear Maſs in this Chapel, and any Prieſt that ſhall ſay Maſs here, on all <hi>Mondays</hi> of the Year, and on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>All-Souls</hi> Day, or any of the Days of the <hi>Octave,</hi> the privilege of Redeeming one Soul out of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> And this is ſaid to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Innocent</hi> XII. the preſent Pope, out of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94187:38"/> the Treaſury of the Church, and is to continue in force for Seven Years. They may, perhaps, by that time get Money enough to renew and continue the Leaſe. The Fraternity or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood of the Dead are a company of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that write their Names in a Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are admitted into the Society: this is commonly done on particular Days fixed and known. They bind themſelves to ſuch and ſuch good Works as are ſpecified in the Rules of the Fraternity for the Relief of the Souls in <hi>Purgatory;</hi> ſuch as Faſting at particular times, going to Maſs in publick, or the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome private Tasks of Devotion, or the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſome Charities to the Poor. And all of the Fraternity promiſe themſelves much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the Indulgences granted to it, and much Comfort and Relief when they die, by Virtue of the Prayers, and good Works, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Mortifications, of all the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
               <p>We come now to the greateſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Churches, which is the Cathedral Church here: 'tis call'd the <hi>Vrouwen Kerk,</hi> or <hi>Our Lady's Church,</hi> becauſe 'tis dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> 'Tis a magnificent, large and curious Structure, worth admiring both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and within, and worth the ſtaying a while about it to take notice of what is here obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Foundations of this Church, they ſay, were laid in the Year 1124 it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Collegiate only, and entertain'd 24 Chanon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with a Dean. But <hi>Philip</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain,</hi> out of a Deſign to preſerve the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion in theſe Countries, erected ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral new Biſhopricks among them, as what he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94187:38"/> thought moſt conducing to this purpoſe. One of theſe fell to the Share of this City, and the firſt Biſhop is named <hi>Franciſcus Sonnius,</hi> who was fixed about the Year 1567. This Church has a great deal of curious carv'd Stone-work on the Outſide, which adorns the lofty Roof of it, and is ſeen above the Houſes that encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it. The Steeple is all Stone from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to the top; it is in height 400 <hi>Antwerp</hi> Feet: from thence in a clear day may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſeen <hi>Mechlin, Louvain, Bruſſels, Ghent,</hi> the Sea, and the Iſlands of <hi>Zeeland</hi> with the naked Eye. The whole Steeple has ſo much carving about it, and is ſuch curious Work, that they ſay the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. viewing it, and conſidering that Time and Weather muſt needs deface the Beauty of it, as is in ſome meaſure already done, ſaid, <hi>It was worthy to be kept in a Caſe, and to be ſhown only upon Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.</hi> In this Steeple there is a Set of perhaps the moſt muſical Chimes in the World; to ſerve which, there are of all Sorts in the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple 68 Bells. The Church is very fine and rich within, in excellent Pieces of Painting in Marble and Braſs Pillars; and the Altars on high Days are adorn'd with a great deal of Riches in Silver Lamps, and Candleſticks, and other Works of Silver. Theſe being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix'd very artificially, with Bundles of Flowers, true in their Seaſon, and ſuch are well counterfeited in Winter, with Bay-trees alſo, and tall lighted Wax-Tapers, all together, make the moſt beautiful Scenes in the World. And when there is added to theſe a Conſort of all ſorts of excellent Muſick, as on ſome Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days the Maſs and all the other Offices of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94187:39"/> Day are perform'd in Muſick, then they make the Church out-do the Play-houſe in that which is moſt pleaſant there; tho perhaps theſe things are not very proper to be mingled with Chriſtian Worſhip, which is deſign'd rather to refine and purifie the mind of Man, and to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it to God and Divine Things, than to pleaſe and charm the Sences with the Pomps and Pleaſures of this World. There are a great many Altars in this Church continually, and to ſome of them are granted the obtaining the ſame Indulgences which are to be gain'd in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> by thoſe who ſhall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit theſe Altars on ſuch and ſuch Holidays of the Year, as are ſpecified: This is ſignified by ſome Prints hanging in Frames in the Church in <hi>Latin,</hi> and in <hi>Low-Dutch:</hi> Beſides theſe, upon ſome Occaſions they erect new Altars for the time.</p>
               <p>There are belonging to this Church ſeveral <note place="margin">Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> Confraternities, which take the Charge and Care upon them to furniſh and adorn par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chapels in it, and to maintain the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Divine Offices in them Some of theſe it may not be amiſs to take notice of here. One is call'd <hi>the Fraternity of the Circumciſion,</hi> which conſiſts of 24 Principal Citizens, ſome Religious and ſome Secular. They maintain the Chapel of the Circumciſion; where they pretend to keep and to ſhow upon particular occaſions the Prepuce or Foreskin which was cut from our Saviour when he was circumcis'd. They ſay it was ſent hither by Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloine</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after that City had been recover'd from the Hands of the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and he was voted K. of it in the Year 1101.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94187:39"/> Another Fraternity is call'd <hi>the Brotherhood of the Chappel of the Virgin Mary;</hi> which conſiſts of almoſt an hundred Brothers, ſome Citizens ſome Foreigners. This Chappel is a large En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure on the Eaſt end of the North Iſle: It has a very high Encloſure, I think of Marble, and at the lower end a Gallery for Muſick, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Marble Pillars. This Brotherhood maintain here, beſides daily Maſſes, and other Offices ordinary and extraordinary, a Sett of Muſick which ſings every day the Hymn <hi>Salve Regina;</hi> which I ſuppoſe to be this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>

               </lg>
               <p>Another is the Fraternity of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who have a Chapel enclos'd at the Eaſt end of the South Iſle of the Church. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition here is, as I remember, all of Marble. This Altar I have obſerv'd on great days ſet off with a great deal of Riches and Finery; and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94187:40"/> theſe maintain here a Maſs and Veſpers with Muſick daily. To this Church alſo belong the 27 Colledges, as they are call'd, of Tradeſmen in this City, who have each of them a Chapel, or an Altar at leaſt; at which they maintain a Maſs upon all Feſtivals of the Year; but upon the Feaſts of the Saints whom they reckon the Patrons of their Trade, they cauſe to be ſung a Solemn Maſs with a Conſort of Muſick.</p>
               <p>There is in this Church at the top of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern a piece of Painting which is very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd; it repreſents a Heaven, as I remember: The Maſter that drew it is one <hi>Mees,</hi> who was lately living in the Town, and perhaps is ſtill there. Here are to be ſeen ſeveral of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pieces of the famous <hi>Rubens</hi>'s drawing. As one comes in at the South Door of the Church there is a Piece of his at the firſt Altar on the right hand: The Altar-piece repreſents our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour a-taking down from the Croſs. There are Folding-doors put up to open and ſhow, or to ſhut and cover this piece. When they are open they ſhow on the inſide of them more of his excellent Work; for he has drawn on one ſide the Viſit which the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> made to her Couſin <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> On the other ſide, I think, he has repreſented the three Kings, as they call them, paying their Adorations to our Saviour at <hi>Bethlehem Rubens,</hi> they ſay, has ſet a very good Picture of his Wife on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe to repreſent the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> Who was, as Tradition tells us, very handſome, but very wanton and ſcandalous. This puts me in mind of what is ſaid to be a common practice among the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; which is, That the Pictures made and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94187:40"/> ſet up in the Churches to repreſent the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> are commonly good and lively Draughts of thoſe lewd Women whom the wicked Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters moſt admir'd. One ſees them indeed uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the moſt beautiful Repreſentations that the Painters Art can poſſibly reach. But concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this practice, I think it may be asked them, tho' not reaſonably queſtion'd, Whether the Pictures of ſuch Women in thoſe places do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Altar or profane the Church? It is eaſie to determine how little a help to Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Pictures muſt be, eſpecially while they repreſent more truely thoſe Women who are known to be vile and filthy, than the bleſſed and pure Virgin who was the Mother of our Lord. Theſe Folding-doors when ſhut have another Picture on the outſide newly drawn, and very well done; which, if one ſhould look upon it after reading the Heathen Story of <hi>Hercules,</hi> one would conclude were a ſwinging <hi>Hercules</hi> with his Club. This is ſet to repreſent St. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and ſo at its times this Altar ſerves <note place="margin">St. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher.</note> for the Devotion to him. It is a Picture of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large Gigantick Man walking, but who ſeems ſcarce able to go under the load he bears, and therefore ſupporting himſelf with his Club, which reaches up to his Arm-pit: And all this ado is only to carry a very little Boy that ſits aſtride upon his Shoulder, and ſeems very waggiſhly to laugh at the pains which he takes to carry him. The fooliſh Legend ſays, Our Saviour put a trick upon St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> in the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a little Child: He ſtood crying by a Brook of Water which he made ſhow as if he muſt go over but was afraid it would drown him; upon which the Saint took up the Child
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94187:41"/> and toſs'd him upon his Shoulder thinking to carry him as inſenſibly as a Fly, but by that time he was got to the middle of the Water the weight of this Child grew ſo great, that he was hardly able to walk or ſtand under him; and full glad was St. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> whoſe Back was almoſt broke, when he was gotten to the other ſide to be rid of his Burden. Becauſe he thus carried Chriſt, as they ſay, he had this Name of <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> which ſignifies a carryer of Chriſt. This indeed is a Story which the wiſeſt among them do not think fit to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore they pretend that this Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is alſo ſymbolical, and repreſents his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying our Saviour about in the Country where he preach'd the Goſpel; which was chiefly in <hi>Lycia,</hi> where they ſay he converted juſt 46000 People to the Chriſtian Faith, and ſuffer'd Martyrdom under the <hi>Decian</hi> Perſecution. But even this matter alſo is owned to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; and a modeſt Author ſays, <hi>We know nothing that is well aſſur'd of his Actions.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is commemorated as a Saint in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the 25th of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and that Church at a venture makes this Prayer with relation to Him at the Maſs of that Day.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94187:41"/> Church. But certainly in the Church of the Bleſſed Virgin we muſt not omit to pay our Reſpects to the High Altar which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dedicated to her. And here, beſides the excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, worth taking notice of, we ſee an excellent piece of the famous <hi>Rubens</hi>'s drawing: <note place="margin">Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </note> This is the Altar-piece which repreſents the pretended Aſſumption or Aſcention of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> into Heaven. There is painted a beautiful Woman cloath'd with rich Silks, mounting towards Heaven with Clouds under her Feet, a Glory all above her, and many Angels about her; ſome admiring, ſome ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſome ſeeming to ſhoulder her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. At the bottom of the piece is a Tomb open, and many Men and Women about it. ſome looking down into the Tomb, ſome ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upwards, and ſheltring their Eyes with their Hands, as if they would defend them from being dazled by the Glory above them. They ſay ſhe did die indeed and was buried, but within three days afterwards ſhe roſe again from the dead and was taken up into Heaven. And one would think by this repreſentation of the matter, that moſt certainly ſhe aſcended into Heaven, as the Scripture ſays our Saviour did, that is, in the ſight of many people, and viſibly attended by Angels in his glorious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Thus is this matter conſtantly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the People in the Pictures of her Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and thus are they taught, poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by Pictures, which in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are the Lay-mens Books, to believe lies. For there is not one bit of all this that is true. The Apoſtles were Witneſſes of our Saviour's Aſcenſion, and have teſtify'd it ſufficiently to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94187:42"/> the World; but as for that of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, tho' the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend many of them were Witneſſes of that, yet there is not a word ſaid of it in any of their Writings, nor do any of the Writings of the Ancients make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. 'Tis confeſt by a modeſt Author, That after the Scripture ſpeaks of her as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Croſs of our Saviour at the time of his Crucifixion, and her being then recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to St. <hi>John</hi> to be reſpected and taken care of by him as if ſhe were his own Mother, there is no more ſaid of her in any Author that is certain, either concerning the reſt of her Life or concerning her Death. <hi>Authors ſay indeed,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that ſhe, having liv'd at</hi> Epheſus <hi>with St.</hi> John, <hi>died there, at the Age of 72 Years, in the Year of our Saviour 56 or 57;</hi> but this is not at all certain he owns, as well as is not her Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; which it would without doubt have been if it had been true. For if ever the Spirit of God had deſign'd ſuch Honours for the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> as are paid her by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this Circumſtance, which is one great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and encouragement of them, would have been order'd by the Divine Providence to have been aſcertain'd beyond all reaſonable doubt or contradiction, as is the Aſcenſion of our Bleſſed Saviour. Another Author ſays <hi>(God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau Hiſt. de l'Egliſe) The Church believes that ſhe was after her death receiv'd into Heaven both in Body and Soul,</hi> but he brings no Teſtimony for it. He acknowledges that the little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning the Aſſumption of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> among the Works of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> is none of that Father's Writings; and that the Homilies on this Feſtival among the Works of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:94187:42"/> are none of his. He deſtroys, too, the pretended Teſtimony of <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> and ſo leaves the Story rather confuted than confirm'd. <hi>Dupin (Nouvelle Bibliotheque)</hi> ſpeaks of that Treatiſe among the Works of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> what is worth obſerving here. <hi>The 10th Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>on the Aſſumption of the Virgin</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>is written by ſome Latin Author who liv'd when the Eaſt was infected with the Errour of the</hi> Eutychians, <hi>(who would acknowledge but one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Jeſus Chriſt) as he obſerves himſelf; and this was what came to paſs long after the death of St.</hi> Jerom. <hi>He that wrote it,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſet it out under the name of St.</hi> Jerome, <hi>that what he ſays of the Bleſſed Virgin might be the more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And the better to colour the Cheat, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to direct it to</hi> Paula <hi>and</hi> Euſtochium <hi>(per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom St.</hi> Jerome <hi>did truly write.) Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' he enlarges upon the Commendations and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of the Virgin, yet</hi> he ſays, it was not certain whether ſhe was riſen from the Dead, and her Body carried up into Heaven or not. <hi>This Treatiſe</hi> (ſays he further) <hi>tho' ſuppoſititious, was inſerted into the Office of the Church by</hi> Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Diaconus <hi>and</hi> Alcuinus <hi>in</hi> Charlemaign's <hi>time: And ſince that it has made up part of the Leſſons for the Feaſt of the Aſſumption in the Old Breviaries of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Italy. Thus ſpeaks <hi>Dupin</hi> of this matter. But notwithſtanding the uncertainty of this Fact, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> celebrates a Day to commemorate this to her Honour, which is the 15th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and a Plenary Indulgence is granted to encourage the Devotions of this Solemnity in this Church; the form of the Publication of which in the Year 1696 was as follows.</p>

               <p>Thus is it confeſs'd, that all this elaborate Devotion is deſign'd as well to the Honour of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> as of God: And is all this no more than with the Spirit of Charity to deſire her Prayers? As much as this comes to is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated 8 or 10 times a Year upon the ſeveral Feſtivals they aſſign to her: Is all this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to engage her Aſſiſtance? Are not here Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honours in the moſt ſolemn manner paid to her, when all this is done for her Honour as well as for God's, and even that which done as is pretended for God's Honour? But let them know, that he who has ſaid, <hi>Mine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will I not give to another,</hi> will not reckon there is any paid to him when that which is due only to him is communicated to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And we may obſerve how undiſtinctly, at leaſt, they ſpeak to the People, and how ill they muſt needs teach them when they ſpeak ſo, in this; that they mention at laſt the moſt Glorious Deity without any Epithet of Honour, but the Virgin is call'd moſt Holy. Certainly if their Prayers for the extirpation of Hereſies, which are always excited on theſe occaſions, had any effect, they would procure the removal of theſe groſs Idolatries from the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>In the entrace of the Office for the Maſs of this Day they ſay: <hi>Let us all rejoyce in the Lord and ſolemnly celebrate this Day in Honour of the Bleſſed</hi> Mary: <hi>For the Aſſumption of whom the Angels rejoyce, and glorifie the Son of God.</hi> Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> produces a Collect for the Day which runs thus:
<q>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94187:45"/>
                     <hi>O Lord, let us receive a Salutary Aſſiſtance from the Solemnity of this Day, whereon the Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent a Temporal Death, but could not be held down by the Chains of that Death,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the day of this Feſtival, and ſo through the whole <hi>Octave,</hi> one ſhall ſee at this Church a number of Puppets dreſs'd up to repreſent her, and hung by Wyres in a ſtrait Line one above another up to the top of the loſty Church, and the higheſt of them are the leaſt, to make the diſtance appear the greater; but they are all dreſs'd exactly alike. Thus are the People taught her Aſſumption: but while they are thus taught by Images and Pictures, we cannot chuſe but think that it would be much better for them if they had more of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and leſs of theſe. This is one of the many Inſtances of Devotion in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which, at leaſt, are groundleſs, and without any Foundation or Warrant in the Word of God. But if that which is done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith, as the Apoſtle ſays, be Sin; and that which has no Foundation or Warrant from the Word of God muſt be done by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence without Faith; then 'tis neceſſary that theſe Devotions, inſtead of being acceptable with God, muſt be ſinful, and an Abomination to him. But there is yet a further Guilt in this matter, and that is, That this with ſeveral Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Devotions paid to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> are deſign'd, and tend to parallel her firſt with our bleſſed Saviour, and then perhaps after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they will advance her above him (as in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94187:45"/> ſome things ſome of them ſeem to do already) for theſe Evil Men and Seducers grow worſe and worſe. Therefore as the Chriſtian Church has obſerv'd a Day, and ſtill does ſo, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate our Saviour's miraculous Conception; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> keeps a Day to celebrate hers, which the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> expreſly calls a miraculous Conception too. As the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church celebrates the Nativity of our Lord, ſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Church celebrates on a particular Feſtival that of the Virgin: As the Chriſtian Church celebrates the Preſentation of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the Temple, as the Firſt-born of his Mother, and a Male, ſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates the Preſentation of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at the Temple; having, as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> ſays, receiv'd it by a pious Tradition come from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> That the bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to God from her Infancy, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him in the Temple. This Story was very ignorantly invented at firſt: For the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Law ordain'd indeed, that the Males ſhould be preſented to God, which were the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of their Mothers, but not the Females. This is very evident in the Scripture, and the Jeſuit <hi>Menochius</hi> ſtates the Law ſo in his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book <hi>De Republica Hebraica.</hi> They comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate her Sufferings as well as thoſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and frequently ſhow her to the People, as having a Sword ſticking in her Breaſt as ſhe ſtands by the Croſs of our Saviour; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they expreſs their Reliance on her Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for the Satisfaction of their Guilt, as they do of thoſe of our Saviour. To conclude, as the Church celebrates the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of our Lord into Heaven, ſo does
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94187:46"/> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that of the bleſſed Virgin, whom by a parallel Title they uſually call <hi>Our Lady.</hi> If all ſhould be here produced which is practiſed in the Veneration of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is allow'd and encourag'd by the publick Authority of the ſame, and taught by their Preachers and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters without Cenſure, yea, with the expreſs Approbation of the Cenſurers; I doubt not but it would appear to any juſt and impartial Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be no hard and unjuſt Appellation, if one ſhould call the People of that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather <hi>Marians</hi> than <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>

We muſt add to theſe alſo the Fraternities which belong to them; and ſometimes an Image they have in

               <p>The Minor Brothers have a good Houſe and <note place="margin">Minorites.</note> a large Church here, and a great Reputation among the People; they go bare-legg'd, but have Sandals on their Feet; they have ſeveral Proceſſions in a Year wherein they appear a great number, and have a great Company of men marching with their Torches before the Hoſt, as if they wanted.

To theſe People are tied the Fraternity of the Cord of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> which enjoys great Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Privileges of the Pope's granting. They have a great Feſtival founded upon a ridiculous Story, which they call <hi>The Feaſt of</hi> Portiuncula.

They look very jolly by Virtue of theſe things, and one may believe, do not fail, ſince they can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it, to indulge themſelves. I think it may
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94187:47"/> not be amiſs to detain the Reader here a little while with a more particular Account of theſe two profitable Privileges belonging to this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which, like the Goods of a Tradeſman's Shop, bring People to their Churches, and Wealth to their Houſes; the rather becauſe by theſe things, as a <hi>Specimen,</hi> it will appear by what baſe Tricks, and palpable Cheats the <hi>Religious Orders,</hi> as they are call'd in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are maintain'd, and ſeveral large Families of idle, uſeleſs, ſupernumerary Prieſts live upon the Sweat and Labour of the meaner people, and grow rich by draining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way gradually from the greater, their Wealth and Poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt give an Account of the Feaſt of <hi>Portiuncula,</hi> as I have it from themſelves: In a ſhort Relation of the Original, and moſt Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ingulgences of our Lady of the Angels, nam'd <hi>Portiuncula,</hi> granted the holy <hi>Francis</hi> by Chriſt himſelf; which is yearly to be obtain'd in the Churches of the Minor Brothers on the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> It is as follows.</p>
               <p>At the diſtance of about a Mile from <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> (where the holy <hi>Francis</hi> was born) there ſtood an old, ruinous, little Chappel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a certain Abbey of St <hi>Benedict;</hi> to this place the holy <hi>Francis</hi> after his Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bore a particular Devotion, and begun to repair the ſame after the beſt manner that he could, and to take it for his ordinary Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, chuſing the ſame for the firſt Settlement and beginning of his Seraphick Order, and call'd it <hi>Our Lady of the Angels;</hi> for that he had often in that place heard the wonderful ſweet Hymns of the Angels of God, and had
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94187:47"/> himſelf there oftentimes enjoy'd their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. He nam'd alſo this Chappel, <hi>Our Lady of</hi> Portiuncula; whether it were from a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of that Name, near which this Chappel might be built, or for that he held this place for his little Portion, (in Latin <hi>Portiuncula)</hi> which God Almighty had allotted him for his Order. Altho' the Foundation at firſt was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall, yet it is through the particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God greatly encreas'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exceedingly renown'd through all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. It was alſo held in ſuch Eſtimation by St. <hi>Francis,</hi> that no man was permitted to come in there but his Brothers only; and of the ſame none might there dwell with him, but ſuch as excell'd in good and exemplary li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p>This now was well enough thought on in a Story ſo ſilly as this will appear; becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretence they can put upon the World what Lyes they pleaſe concerning St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Miracles and miraculous Entertainments here; as it is the common Character of their feign'd Miracles by which they pretend to confirm and recommend their Fopperies, and Superſtitions, and Idolatries, that they are always done in a Corner, and hid from the World, there are none of them that ever appear'd in publick, or in any great Concourſe of People, or to any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>But to go on with my Tale: It came to paſs (they ſay) in the Year 1221. about the Month of <hi>October,</hi> as the holy <hi>Francis</hi> was in his Cell very zealouſly and heartily praying to God for Sinners, an Angel appear'd to him, who ſaid, That <hi>he muſt go immediately into the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94187:48"/> that our Saviour and his moſt Holy Mother, with an innumerable Multitude of Angels were waiting for him.</hi> (It was really very conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendingly done for this great Company to come firſt and wait for him; or rather moſt impudently was the Story thus devis'd; but this Honour which they give St. <hi>Francis,</hi> is little to what the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of the <hi>Minorites</hi> aſcribes to him; I mean the great Book I have ſeen of the Conformities of St. <hi>Francis</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt.) Upon this St. <hi>Francis</hi> went into the Church, and ſaw there the Lord Chriſt, on whoſe Right-hand ſtood his Bleſſed Mother en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd with an innumerable Company of Angels: Whereupon he fell flat on his Face to the Earth, and continued there his devout Prayers to the Lord and his Mother: (Was this an Exerciſe of Devotion in St. <hi>Francis</hi> to pray to the Virgin together with Chriſt, or done only with the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Spirit of Charity?) But the Lord Jeſus ſaid to him, <hi>Francis, you and your Brothers</hi> (precious Men) <hi>are extreamly ſolicitous for the Salvation of Men; ſeek therefore of me for the Salvation of the People, for the Comfort of Souls, and for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Honour of my Name, all that which you deſire, and it ſhall undoubtedly be granted you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Francis</hi> lay ſtretch'd out before the Face of God altogether tranſported in Spirit; but being come a little to himſelf, and being ſtrengthned in the inner Man, he took Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and ſaid; <hi>O moſt Holy Father! I a poor Sinner, pray and intreat moſt humbly, that your Divine Majeſty will be pleaſed to grant Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind this Favour, That all thoſe who ſhall come to</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:94187:48"/> 
                  <hi>this Church, may be favour'd and indulg'd with a full Forgiveneſs of all their Sins which they have confeſs'd to the Prieſt. I alſo pray you, moſt Holy Mother, Advocatreſs of the Generations of Men, that your moſt gracious Majeſty will be pleaſed to help me in my Requeſt.</hi> The moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Queen of Heaven being mov'd by the Prayer of <hi>her Servant Francis</hi> begun immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to entreat her Son, ſaying, <hi>Moſt Holy Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, I humbly entreat your Godhead, that your Majeſty will be pleaſed to hear and favour your and</hi> my Servant <hi>Francis.</hi> Hereupon ſaid the Lord to him, Francis, <hi>the thing you ſeek is truly very great, but you are worthy of more than that: I conſent to your Prayer, but I deſire you would go to my Stadtholder, and from him in my Name ſeek this Indulgence;</hi> and thereupon did the Lord and his Company leave the Church and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
               <p>The Brothers, who were Twelve in number, (which is doubtleſs one of the Conformities of St. <hi>Francis</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt) and who dwelt with St. <hi>Francis</hi> in this place, and were all of them in their Cells, ſaw a mighty Glory in the Church, and around it multitudes of Angels; they heard alſo very diſtinctly all that paſſed, but through Fear and Aſtoniſhment durſt not venture into the Church, nor indeed ſtir from their Cells.</p>
               <p>The day following, St. <hi>Francis</hi> with one of his Brothers, travell'd to <hi>Peruſia,</hi> where the Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third held his Court, and being admitted to him, he humbly ſaid, <hi>Moſt holy Father, I have, not long ſince, repair'd a Church to the Honour of the holy Mother of God; whereupon I intreat that your Holineſs would be</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:94187:49"/> 
                  <hi>pleas'd to grant, that a plenary and free Indulgence ſhould therein be obtain'd without Offerings.</hi> The Pope ſaid, <hi>Such a thing as that could not be; foraſmuch as whoever will enjoy an Indulgence, they muſt by all means merit or obtain this by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at leaſt ſome Alms.</hi> (This is well ſaid, and and opens all the Trick and Cheat of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.)</p>
               <p>The Pope asked further, How many Years he deſir'd this Indulgence ſhould extend to? St. <hi>Francis</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>I intreat that your Holineſs will be pleas'd to grant, That all they who with Penitence come into this Church, and confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and have receiv'd Abſolution, may be abſolv'd both in Heaven and Earth from all Guilt and Puniſhment from the time of their Baptiſm to the time that they come into this Church.</hi> As the Pope made a Difficulty to grant this, St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Lord, I ſeek this Indulgence not of my ſelf, but in the Name of Chriſt who hath ſent me.</hi> Then did the Pope give his Conſent, but through the Inſtigation of ſome Cardinals, he order'd that this Indulgence ſhould indeed be continued for ever, but that it ſhould not be obtain'd on more than one day in a Year. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, St. <hi>Francis,</hi> with great Reverence, taking his leave, the Pope call'd to him, and ſaid, <hi>Well Brother Simplicity, and what Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity have you now for your Indulgence?</hi> St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Lord, your Word is enough for me, for God ſhall further his own Work, and I deſire no other Bull; for our good Lady ſhall be the Paper, Chriſt the Notary, and the Angels the Witneſſes:</hi> (And doubtleſs it was very proper that all theſe ſhould be thus concern'd about ſo precious and important a matter.)</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:94187:49"/>
               <p>And this matter was very wiſely manag'd all this while, or at leaſt very ſillily devis'd; for they go on and ſay, It was now two Years that St. <hi>Francis</hi> had obtain'd this divine Indulgence, but there was yet no day ſettled whereon the World ſhould obtain it. St. <hi>Francis</hi> expecting that God, who had granted the ſame, ſhould alſo reveal the Day: the which came to paſs in the Month of <hi>January</hi> of the Year 1223. in the following manner: (for this Circumſtance was omitted purpoſely before, for a pretence to bring in more ridiculous and lying Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to recommend St. <hi>Francis</hi> and his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.)</p>
               <p>As St. <hi>Francis</hi> at Midnight was praying in his Cell, the Enemy came to him with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Friendſhip, ſaying, <hi>Francis, wherefore will you deſtory your ſelf before your time? Why do you ſo mortifie your ſelf with Watching? Know you not that Sleep is the principal Cheriſher of Life, and very neceſſary and profitable for a young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi> The holy Father obſerving the Artifice of the Devil, threw off his upper Cloathing, and having nothing on but his Drawers, in fervour of Spirit run out of his Cell, and creeping through a thick Thorn-Hedge, he forc'd his way into a neighbouring Wood, where he tumbl'd his Body among the Briars and Thorns till it was all over bloody, ſaying to himſelf, <hi>'Tis much better that I by ſuffering this, do fill up the Sufferings of Chriſt, than that I ſhould ſuffer my ſelf to be prevail'd upon by the Enemy.</hi> The Enemy being thus drove away, a great Light ſhin'd round about him: And altho' this was in the middle of Winter, nevertheleſs he ſaw about him red and white Roſes in abundance.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94187:50"/> At length a multitude of Angels came about him, and ſaid, Francis, <hi>get up quickly, and go into the Church, for Chriſt and his Mother wait for you there.</hi> He ſtanding up ſeem'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have upon him a mira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ulous bright and white Garment; and having gather'd Twelve white, and Twelve red Roſes, he went into the Church, (but a civil Saint would not have ſtaid to do this, when ſuch Perſons were wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him.) All the way as he went ſeem'd to him to be ſpread with Silken and Purple Tapeſtry. Being then with great Reverence come into the Church, he ſaw there the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with his bleſſed Mother, and a great multitude of Angels, he thereupon falling to his Prayers, ſaid, <hi>Our moſt holy Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, and Saviour of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, may it pleaſe you of your great mercy to appoint a particular Day for the Indulgence you have granted to this place.</hi> Then the holy Mother of God praying alſo for him, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I will that the particular Day ſhall be that on which my Apoſtle</hi> Peter <hi>was looſed from his Bonds, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the ſecond Veſpers of that day, and continuing to the Veſpers of the day following, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding alſo the Night between both, within which time all that come into this Church ſhall enjoy the Indulgence.</hi> Then the Angels ſet up a ſinging the <hi>Te Deum</hi> (with a great deal of Reaſon certainly for ſo great a Benefit granted to the World.)</p>
               <p>Many ſilly and riculous Circumſtances more are mention'd in the Story; but to be ſhort: He went to the Pope, ſhow'd his fine flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Roſes in Winter, and by Virtue of them obtain'd this Indulgence, as the particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94187:50"/> and Pleaſure of Jeſus Chriſt through the Interceſſion of his moſt holy Mother; the whole Grant they ſtate thus: That all, who from the Veſpers of the firſt Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the Veſpers of the following Day, ſhall come into the Church of our Lady of the Angels, ſhall obtain full Remiſſion of all their Sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from their Baptiſm to the Hour that they come into that Church, having confeſs'd with Repentance, and receiv'd Abſolution of the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>This Indulgence was a long time to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd only in this little Church call'd <hi>Portiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula;</hi> but perilous Times ſucceeding, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming very troubleſom and difficult for thoſe eſpecially in Foreign Countries, to come hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>or for it, at length his Holineſs, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Tenth, in the Year 1622. upon the 4th. day of <hi>July</hi> granted, That the ſame Indulgence ſhould be obtain'd by all Chriſtians in all and every the Churches of the Minor Brothers Order, through the whole World, as fully as if they came to the Church <hi>Portiuncula</hi> it ſelf. That is to ſay, the Order encreaſed, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Families of them came to be ſpread about in ſeveral Countries, and this is one of the Tricks to maintain them by; and therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Houſe of them muſt be furniſh'd with this gainful Privilege; for we are not to forget, that an Indulgence is not to be had without leaving ſome Offering of Alms, as 'tis call'd, where that is obtain'd; that is to ſay, it is not to be had without Money.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what Foundation they have for the Devotions of this great Feſtival, and this is as good as that of many others. Upon the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94187:51"/> Credit of this fooliſh, abſurd and impious Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry do thouſands of People run, on this day, to the Churches of theſe Monks, to have their Sins pardon'd; Princes, Stateſmen, Phyſicians, Lawyers, Divines, leave their important Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to attend the Devotions of this day, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe who are joyn'd to theſe Monks by being of the Brotherhood of the Cord of St. <hi>Francis.</hi> Certainly the Doctrine of Implicite Faith and Blind Obedience muſt be very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to this purpoſe. But to curſe, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, murther and damn People as Hereticks becauſe they do not believe and comply with ſuch Stuff as this, muſt be as much beſide true Chriſtian Charity, as the other is beſide a true Faith.</p>
               <p>But let us look a little alſo into the Trick of the Fraternities, and ſee how theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd and manag'd for the making proviſion for theſe idle, uſeleſs Drones, call'd Religious, among whom the Chriſtian Faith, like ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Water, has been ſo monſtrouſly corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of being exercis'd duly in Works truly good. And upon conſideration of the matter, we ſhall find theſe Fraternities to be as great and wicked a Corruption of Chriſtian Religion as any is in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as any can be.</p>
               <p>To theſe Monks belongs the Fraternity of the Cord of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> by Virtue of which many of the People are joyn'd to them, coming to publick Worſhip conſtantly in their Meeting-Places, and receiving all Adminiſtrations of the Divine Ordinances from them. I ſhall give ſome Account of this from what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſay of it in a Book written to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94187:51"/> it to the People, call'd <hi>The little Spiritual Wine-preſs;</hi> or a ſhort Account of the Original, Worthineſs, Miracles, Conditions, Priviledges, Fruits, Indulgences of the far renowned Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherhood of the holy Five Wounds and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, nam'd <hi>the Cord of St.</hi> Francis. It is pretended indeed, that this Fraternity is ſet up to honour and commemorate the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Jeſus Chriſt; but we ſhall find by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it, that 'tis rather deſign'd to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and to maintain theſe his Brothers. To ſhow how acceptable to God the Remembrance of Chriſt's Sufferings is, they tell this Story of St. <hi>Francis:</hi> He had, they ſay, ſuch Compaſſion and Devotion to the bitter Sufferings of Chriſt, that he would often burſt out with Tears, and cry and moan moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, as if Men were putting him to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Torment: Therefore Chriſt alſo honour'd him with the Marks of his holy Five Wounds, to renew in the World the Remembrance of his Benefits and Love ſhown to us in his bitter Sufferings (So the World is to remember the Sufferings of Chriſt by the Wounds of St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis;</hi> and I doubt not 'tis one Conformity of the pretended Saint to Jeſus Chriſt, that Men muſt expect to be ſav'd by the Merits of his Wounds too.) They ſay, that St. <hi>Francis</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Scripture read, <hi>Provide neither Gold, nor Silver, nor Braſs in your Purſes, nor Scrip for your Journey, neither Shoes;</hi> he immediately threw off his Shoes, diſpoſed of the little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he had, and his Purſe too; and laid aſide his Girdle, and inſtead of it, girt himſelf with a Cord. But certainly, if this Scripture is to be taken in the ſtrict literal Sence for a common
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94187:52"/> Rule, St. <hi>Francis</hi> ſhould have let alone the Cord, and not have girt himſelf at all, for even the Cord might be reckon'd a Girdle. But for all that, they tell us, that through this Cord Almighty God has done many wonderful Works; ſo that not only the Cord, but alſo the Water in which the Cord had been waſh'd, would heal Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; which ſignifies in what great Eſteem men ought to hold this Cord. But is it poſſible for any man ſeriouſly to think it worth while for the Infinite Wiſdom and Power to alter the Courſe of Nature, and work. Miracles for the Honour of this Cord? Certainly nothing can be more impious and blaſphemous, than the aſcribing to the great Sovereign, and Author of the World, the working Miracles on ſo trifling Occaſions, as they many times find for them, in the Hiſtories of their Saints; which is as if the Divine Power, like a paultry Jugler, would ſhow Tricks for the ſake of ſhowing them. To go on:</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. granted to the Order of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Brothers the Power to adminiſter the Cord to all Chriſtian People, with great Indulgences and Priviledges. Many Great and Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have born this Cord openly, namely, 4 Popes, 48 Cardinals, 2 Emperors, 12 Kings, many other Noble, and a multitude of meaner People. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> through his pious and religious Charity, eſtabliſh'd in the Year 1586. this Archbrotherhood of the Cord of <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> for the purpoſes following.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, to renew the remembrance of the Sufferings of Chriſt, as is pretended, but it might have been let alone for all this, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt himſelf has left us a fit and ſufficient
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94187:52"/> memorial of them in the Sacrament of his Supper.</p>
               <p>2. He having obſerv'd how great Devotion many People bore to the H. <hi>Francis,</hi> who yet had no opportunity to forſake the World and live under the direction of any of his 3 Holy Rules; he therefore inſtituted this Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that they might at leaſt in the wearing of this Cord become the followers of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> be excited to all Virtue, and might live and die in the love of God.</p>
               <p>3. And alſo, that all faithful People, through the whole World, who afford daily Suſtenance and Food to the minor Brothers, may from the ſame Religious receive Spiritual Gifts and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. And this without doubt is the chief reaſon for this wiſe Inſtitution; to encourage and oblige an eaſie and abus'd Devotion to contribute real Benefits for the empty return of Imaginary ones.</p>
               <p>Further to recommend this Brotherhood, or wheedle, the People are told, that among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Privileges granted by God himſelf to the H. Father <hi>Francis,</hi> this is one; That he ſhould releaſe every Year upon the day of his Feſtival all the Souls of thoſe of his three Orders, and the Souls of thoſe who have been Benefactors to them from the diſmal Fire of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>The mighty Privileges and Benefits belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Fraternity are too many to be here enumerated, but I ſhall mention ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that enter themſelves herein ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the Indulgences and Favours granted to the minor Brothers. They ſhall be partakers of the merits of all the Faſts, Prayers, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and other good Works which are done
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94187:53"/> through the whole World by (thoſe who live cloiſter'd in eternal Idleneſs) the Order of minor Brothers, the Clariſſes, the third Rule, and by the whole Brotherhood of the Cord.</p>
               <p>They ſhall receive Plenary Indulgence upon the day of their coming into the Brotherhood once, and at the day of their Death: Upon all the Feaſt-days of our Saviour, and upon all the Feſtivals of our good Lady; upon St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>'s day; All-Saints-day; and through the whole good Week before <hi>Eaſter:</hi> This is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the Brothers and Siſters of the Archbrotherhood ought to ſeek of their Father Conſeſſor, who muſt alſo be a Minorite, theſe great Indulgences and Abſolutions.</p>
               <p>Plenary Indulgence to all thoſe of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood who ſhall joyn in the monthly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Archbrotherhood, and to thoſe who are not of the Brotherhood, but ſhall join in that Proceſſion, an Indulgence of an hundred Years. At <hi>Ruremond, Venlo,</hi> &amp;c. upon the firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> of the Month; at <hi>Bruſſels, Bruges,</hi> &amp;c. upon the 2d <hi>Sunday;</hi> at <hi>Loven, Antwerp,</hi> &amp;c. upon the 3d <hi>Sunday.</hi> At <hi>Boils le duc</hi> and <hi>Maeſyck</hi> upon the 4th <hi>Sunday.</hi> (And thus are conſiderable portions of God's peculiar time applyed to the Honour of this pretended Saint.)</p>
               <p>Plenary Indulgence for thoſe that ſay or hear the Maſs of the Immaculate Conception, (which Chimera the Followers of this <hi>Francis</hi> are great ſticklers for) they praying for the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Plenary Indulgence for thoſe that read the Roſary of our Lady, namely, 72 <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:94187:53"/> and 7 <hi>Pater Noſters</hi> with a <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> and <hi>Ave Mary</hi> for his Holineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth has granted 30 days Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for thoſe who viſit the Churches of the minor Brothers; an hundred days to thoſe that hear Maſs there, or any Divine Service: Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years and 323 Days of Indulgence for thoſe that hear Sermon: And thoſe who in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Church ſhall go to hear a minor Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preach ſhall enjoy an Indulgence of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years 222 Days.</p>
               <p>Plenary Indulgence for all thoſe who at their Death deſire out of Devotion, to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Habit of the minor Brothers being Men, or if Women in that of the Clariſſes.</p>
               <p>Plenary Indulgence for the Parents who have Children in the Order of the minor Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being in the ſtate of Grace, and that for ſo many times as they have Sons in that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which Indulgence the Children may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to their Parents when dead, by ſaying a Maſs near their Graves: (To this purpoſe they will be induced to order themſelves to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Churches, and without doubt good Preſents and Legacies are uſually made to theſe good Brothers, both for the Habit, and for the Burying-place.)</p>
               <p>A multitude of Lying Wonders are produc'd to recommend this bleſſed Cord (which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of them deſerve to have about their Necks for their pains) I ſhall only tell one Story which is a little diverting though it has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the Air of Falſhood and Folly: For by this wondrous Cord a Saint of the Order chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the grand Deceiver, and made a meer Aſs of the Devil: O fine! the truth on't is, the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94187:54"/> old Fellow does ſo often cheat us all that one would be pleaſed to underſtand that He ſhould ever be put upon himſelf: The Story runs thus. The good Father <hi>Martinus Ruis</hi> not being able to paſs the River <hi>Guadarrama,</hi> as he ſtood care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon the Brink about the matter, there comes down to the Water near him an Aſs: The good Man knew by an Inſpiration that this was the Devil, and that he roguiſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, if the good Man ſhould offer to mount him, to carry him into the midſt of the River, and there throw him off and drown him; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he goes to the Aſs, nimbly ſlips the Cord of St. <hi>Francis</hi> about his Neck, and then he had him ſecure, and a mighty thing I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you it was, that a Man could make any good of the Devil; yet he did, for he mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Devil carried him ſafely through the River, he kept him in ſervitude ſtill, rid him to <hi>Toledo,</hi> forced him to drudge there in carrying Stones and heavy Burdens to ſerve the Repair of the Cloiſter. ('Tis well we have it once acknowldg'd, that the Devil was ſerviceable to the erecting of any of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Religious Houſes.) But the good Man gave a Charge that no one ſhould ever take off this Cord, and ſo the poor Devil wore it, and continued in the ſhape and ſlavery of an Aſs many Years. At length as he ſtood bound to a Crib, while two Fathers of the Order look'd on, who were ſtrangers to this Convent and to the Matter, he made ſhew to them of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling himſelf with his Cord, and to be in danger of being ſtrangled by it; upon which the good Fathers ran to relieve him, and ſlipt the Cord off from him. That was it the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94187:54"/> wanted, and away he vaniſh'd immediately with loud outcries and howlings, and left a moſt fearful ſtink behind him. And ſo much for that.</p>
               <p>Let us obſerve in the laſt place ſome of the Rules and Conſtitutions of the Brotherhood. Every one that will become a Brother muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Name in the Book of the Archbrother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. They muſt receive the Cord, being bleſſed, from the Hands of a Superiour of the minor Brothers; muſt gird themſelves daily with the ſame, wearing it either above or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Cloaths: They may put it off at Night going to Bed, and put it on again in the Morning when they riſe. If the Cord be loſt or when 'tis worn out they may ask for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſecrated one, or provide it themſelves, and carry it to be bleſt. They muſt read com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly every Day 5 <hi>Pater Noſters</hi> and 5 <hi>Ave Maries</hi> with the 5 Salutations of the 5 Wounds to the Honour of the 5 Wounds of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>All the Brothers muſt come to a Monthly Aſſembly at ſome time and place convenient: At which time one of theſe Fathers ſhall make an Exhortation to them. (Without doubt to be true to the Cord, that they may go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a String, and he will tell them many a fine ſtory of the Virtues of the Cord.) The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions in theſe Aſſemblies are to begin with (the Ancient and Venerable) Hymn <hi>Veni Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> (which is worthy of a much better Office;) and muſt end with the Litany of St. <hi>Francis</hi> or of our good Lady. A number of the Brothers call'd out by the Servant of the Brotherhood ſhall honour with a Light the H. Sacrament of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94187:55"/> the Altar in the monthly Proceſſion, as alſo in the Proceſſion of <hi>Portiuncula,</hi> &amp;c. to which end a number of Flambeau's or Wax-Candles ſhall be kept, to which the Brothers ſhall be pleas'd to contribute. As any one of the Brothers comes to be ſick the Father ſhall be told of it, who ſhall take care that he be provided of the Holy Sacrament, and be viſited by other Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers according to Quality and Opportunity: And the Servant of the Brotherhood ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all the Brothers in the Town, or that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit near it, to attend the Sacrament to the ſick perſon and honour it with the Flambeau's of the Brotherhood. When any Brother dies, Brothers are to be invited to attend the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; the Maſs of <hi>Requiem</hi> ſhall according to order be ſung in the Convent to which all Brothers ſhall be invited, as alſo the ſame Maſs ſhall be ſaid in the <hi>Octave</hi> of St. <hi>Francis</hi> for all thoſe who are departed of this Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>When they put on the Cord in the Morning they are to ſay this Prayer following;
<q>Vouchſafe, O Lord, to gird me with the Girdle of Purity, that the Virtue of Chaſtity may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abide in me, and I may wear this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Cord for the forgiveneſs of my Sins, through the Merit of the Cords and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And what need is there I wonder of wearing this Cord in order to obtain the forgiveneſs of Sin by the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt? Will it be ſaid, the Merit of theſe are not ſufficient unleſs a Man do hereby apply or tie to himſelf the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94187:55"/> Merits of St. <hi>Francis</hi> and his Order? And is it not plain they reckon this addition at leaſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful, and ſo rely upon the Merits of this pretended Saint as well as upon thoſe of Chriſt; and give him a part in this Honour of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But to crown all, let us obſerve the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Proteſtation which they muſt uſe at the entring themſelves into this Brotherhood, which is as follows:
<q>I N. N. <hi>take for my particular Mediation with Almighty God, the moſt Holy Maid and Mother of God</hi> Mary; <hi>the H. Father</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus, <hi>with all the Saints of his Order; the which I ſhall never forſake, and againſt the Honour of whom I ſhall never do any thing, nor will I ſuffer that any under my Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall by my conſent or connivance do any ſuch thing. In all things I reſign my ſelf to the Obedience of the Holy</hi> Roman <hi>Church. I beſeech you then, O moſt H. Maid and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Mary, <hi>and you, O Holy Father</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, <hi>with your holy Company, that you will be pleaſed to receive me for your</hi> Servant, <hi>and</hi> ſtand by me in all my Works and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, <hi>that I may follow your good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and, through a ſaving Death, may be partaker with you of everlaſting Glory.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And will not this ſolemn Proteſtation and Prayer allow'd in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and encourag'd by Popes and Indulgencies go for an Addreſs to the Saints for their immediate help when the B. Virgin and <hi>Francis</hi> are deſir'd to ſtand by them? Is it only the Spirit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that makes them devote themſelves thus to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94187:56"/> theſe perſons in poſtures and forms of Worſhip, and to ſay to them, <hi>Receive me for your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?</hi> And when in this Form there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, but a choice is made of others by Name for this purpoſe, and a Proteſtation ſolemnly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of relying and truſting to their Mediation, may we not ſuſpect that of our Saviour is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten for the preſent? However do they not herein advance theſe Saints to the Honour of Mediators together with him at leaſt, when they ſometimes betake themſelves to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation without Him? If one would interpret this practice to the worſt Sence it can bear, it might be ſaid they herein preferr theſe Saints before our moſt Bleſſed Saviour, and chuſe theſe for their peculiar and chief Mediators, or inſtead of Jeſus Chriſt. But I would wrong no body, and would exerciſe Charity to all men, therefore I would not impute this to them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Carmes <hi>the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the V.</hi> Mary.</note> that is, the Brothers of our Lady, by whom they mean no leſs perſon than the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> have alſo a large and lofty Church, and a good large Houſe: They are a great Company, go with bare Legs, but with San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals on their Feet too, and look well. They are belonging to them, among other Wheedles to draw Trade and Cuſtom, the Fraternity of the <hi>Scapulary</hi> or Shoulder-cloathing, a part of their Habit; which <hi>Scapulary</hi> they ſay was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the bleſſed <hi>Simon Stock,</hi> a Saint of their Order, by the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf: And there are large Indulgences granted to this Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Chappels of this Order. Something more particularly of this matter will come in when we are at <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi> where we ſhall meet with the Feſtival that commemorates this great thing. But the Jeſuites, envious at the eſteem which they have among the People, and at the Trade they draw, ſet themſelves to diſparage or call in queſtion this, and ſome other pretences upon which they value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And to this purpoſe in their <hi>Acta San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum</hi> they criticize upon them. For which boldneſs the <hi>Carmes</hi> ſet to work, and us'd their Intereſt ſo well in <hi>Spain</hi> that they got this Book condemn'd at <hi>Toledo</hi> by the Inquiſition under a great many odious Epithets, and burnt in publick by their Officer, in the Year 1696. They are alſo hard at work to get it condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Jeſuites are labouring to prevent this. The <hi>Carmes</hi> have not been able as yet to gain that point, but they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Pope to give them a Teſtimony of his Eſteem and Favour, and to do ſomething
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94187:58"/> to ſupport their Eſteem among the People. Accordingly he has this Year granted to the general Chapter of theſe <hi>Carmes,</hi> expreſsly for promoting their good ſucceſs, and the encreaſe of their Order, as well as for the greater Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God and the Salvation of Men, a Plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Indulgence to all that ſhall viſit their Churches upon the Feaſt of the Aſcenſion of our Saviour, and from thence to <hi>Whit-Sunday</hi> incluſively to be preſent at ſuch and ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions ſpecified. The time that we came to <hi>Antwerp</hi> was within that compaſs, and the place of our Lodging on the <hi>Mere</hi> being over againſt one entrance to their Church, we could obſerve a great many People haſting in thither: This drew us thither too, believing there was ſomething extraordinary, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we found by printed Papers poſted up, as is uſual, that this was the occaſion of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. It was, I think, the time of <hi>Compline,</hi> as they call it, which is the laſt Office of the Day. They commonly begin and end this Service on Feſtival-times, as this was, with the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Holy Sacrament, which is thus perform'd: The Prieſt brings it out in a rich <note place="margin">Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Remonſtranter at the beginning, and very gravely holding it before him, turns himſelf a little ſucceſſively towards both ſides of the Chappel, and ſo ſhews it to the People who all proſtrate themſelves and adore it: This done, he ſets it up in a place fitted for it on the Altar; and when the Office is done, this formality is repeated again: This they call the <hi>Benediction,</hi> and thoſe who cannot be preſent at the whole Service will ſometimes make great haſte to ſecure the Felicity of the Benediction
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94187:58"/> at the end, which they are warn'd of by a Bell, as I now obſerv'd. We ſaw now the Church-Yard, which is not a ſmall one, full of Coaches, and the large Church throng'd with People. And three of their Prieſts were at the High Altar in very rich Copes which ſeem'd at a diſtance to be Cloth of Silver, with a great deal of Embroidery upon them in Gold and Silver: But, as is uſual with Copes, this Embroidery was ſome of it perhaps laid on in the form of a Croſs which reaches from the top to the bottom, and from one ſide to the other of the Cope behind, for theſe good Men are proud of bearing the Croſs after Chriſt. I fancy ſuch a Croſs as this would not be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſtumbling Block or to the <hi>Greeks</hi> Fooliſhneſs, tho' the Croſs of Chriſt was ſo: This is their Croſs indeed, and in hot weather ſomewhat a heavy one, alas, but little a-kin after all to the Croſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe People have here on the North ſide of the Quire a pretty cloſe Chappel dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Floor, the Walls, and the Arch'd Roof are all Marble, the Floor black and white, and the reſt white. On the Wall, upon the Right-hand as one goes in, there are two pieces of very curious carv'd Work in two Pannels, as I may ſpeak, of the Marble; the one is a Proſpect of the City of <hi>Antwerp:</hi> The other is an Army rang'd in its feveral Battalions of Horſe and Foot, where ones ſees the Men and the Horſes of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies diſtinctly cut. In this Chappel over the Altar there ſtands an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> crown'd, as tall I believe as a Child of two Years old, with a Child in her Arms, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94187:59"/> theſe ſeem'd, and the Monk told us, they are Maſſy Silver. They ſhew too a ſmall Effigies of a Man in a Coffin with the <hi>Scapular</hi> on, to be ſure, in which it muſt be ſuppoſed he died and was buried that he might aſſuredly be ſav'd. This is ſaid to be the Man who erected this Chappel, he was as I rember a rich Merchant of <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us return to the Indulgences ſo often <note place="margin">Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> mention'd, which the poor People ſo eagerly run after, and conſider them a little upon this Occaſion once for all, that we may underſtand the Reaſon, and Uſe, and the Cheat of them. Indulgences are the great Manufacture, as we may ſay, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that which ſupports their Trade and brings in their Wealth. That which gathers, and binds together the Fraternities who at their charge erect, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and maintain ſome Altars and Chappels, and the worſhip of ſome particular Saints, is that ſeveral Indulgences are granted to that Fraternity to be obtain'd at thoſe Altars and Chappels. That which draws the multitude to Church, to be preſent at a Maſs, and other Devotions on their numerous Holidays is the grant of Indulgences to be obtain'd there at thoſe times. When any Church or Chappel wants repairing, begins to be deſerted, or wants more Finery and Riches, new Indulgences are grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe that ſhall come to Maſs at that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar or Chappel. When the Pope has a mind to favour any knot of Secular Prieſts, or any Religious Order, he grants them ſome new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences to be obtain'd by thoſe who ſhall come to hear them ſay Maſs at certain appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed times at their Churches or Chappels. But
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94187:59"/> whatever other Preparation they have or want, in order to partake of theſe Benefits, they muſt not think to do it without an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. So the Indulgences bring People, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bring Money, and Money anſwers all things with them. This is the real Uſe and Deſign of theſe things; they are very profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Prieſts, but let us ſee what an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they are pretended to be to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and how groundleſs and falſe that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is, and how the real Cheat of all may be diſcover'd.</p>
               <p>We ſhall ſtrictly follow the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> in taking an Account of the Doctrine of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, whoſe Expoſitions are become Oracles in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He puts his Account of their Doctrine of Satisfaction for Sin, and of Purgatory, and of Indulgences together: And indeed they are all, as well as they can be, joyn'd together in the Doctrine of that Church. The Catholicks, (ſaies he, meaning the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> do with one Conſent teach, That Jeſus Chriſt alone, God and Man, was capable by the infinite Dignity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to offer to God a Satisfaction ſufficient for our Sins. But he having ſuperabundantly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, could apply that his infinite Satisfaction to us in theſe two different manners: Either he could give us an entire Diſcharge, without the Reſerve of any Pain or Penalty to be ſuffered by our ſelves; Or elſe he could eſtabliſh a Commutation of a greater Pain for a leſſer: That is to ſay, He could excuſe us from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Pain due to our Sins, and leave us bound to ſome Temporal Pains; and this is that which he has done, with relation to thoſe who fall
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94187:60"/> into Sin after their Baptiſm. They muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſome Temporal Pain, tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Eternal be remitted to them. And it is not to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thence (ſaies he) that Jeſus Chriſt has not entirely ſatisfied for us, but on the contrary, that he having acquir'd an abſolute Right or Propreity over us, by the infinite Price he has given for our Salvation, he gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s us our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon ſuch a Condition, or ſuch a Law, and with ſuch a Reſerve as he pleaſes. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſatisfie this Obligation that we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſome Penalty which we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh in the Spirit of Humility and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And it was the neceſſity of theſe ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Works which oblig'd the Ancient Church to impoſe upon Penitents the Penalties which are call'd Canonical. When therefore the Church impoſes upon Sinners the Works that are penal and laborious, and it is ſo that they ſubmit to them with Humility, this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Satisfaction; and when, having regard to the Fervour of the Penitents, or to other good Works which ſhe has preſcrib'd to them, ſhe relaxes ſome part of the Pain that was due, this is call'd Indulgence. Thoſe that go out of this Life with Grace and Charity, but are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſtill indebted for ſome Pains which the divine Juſtice has reſerv'd, muſt ſuffer them in another Life, that is in Purgatory. This Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory <note place="margin">Purgatory</note> they make as frightful as they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to do: they ſay the Pains are the ſame with thoſe in Hell: they ſet the place of it, as it were, on the Suburbs of Hell, and repreſent it as incomparably more intollerable than all that can be endur'd in this World: inſomuch that if we might believe the Stories which they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94187:60"/> have of the Apparitions and Complaints of Souls tortur'd there, it were more eligible and better to be endur'd, to live quite through an ordinary Life on Earth under the moſt wrack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tormenting Diſeaſe, than to lie but for a day in Purgatory. But theſe miſerable Wretches who are there, have this Relief, as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> ſays, That God has ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd the Advantages of brotherly Charity, and the Communion of Saints, that oftentimes he receives the Satisfactions which we offer for one another. So the Souls in Purgatory they pretend, may be reliev'd, and either eaſed there, or deliver'd from thence by the Satisfactions of their Friends, for them, who are living on Earth. Theſe Satisfactions their living Friends muſt give for them, either by doing ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Works, or by ſuffering many hard and voluntary Penances themſelves; or elſe they muſt purchaſe a good parcel of Satisfactions for them out of the Treaſury of the Church, which the Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Biſhops in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Dioceſſes, have, as they pretend, the Power to diſpence, and to communicate or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to whom they pleaſe. This Treaſure of the Church, as they pretend, is made up of the infinite Satisfactions of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Satisfactions of the Saints. The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> ſays, He mentions thoſe of the Saints, becauſe the Goodneſs of God is ſuch, that he is willing, out of Favour to the more pious of his Servants, to ſuffer himſelf to be, for their ſakes, the more gentle, and eaſie to others. This, ſaies he, is the Foundation of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They are eſtabliſh'd to relax the Rigour of the temporal Pains due to ſin. They are not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94187:61"/> deſign'd, he ſays, to diſcharge us from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations we lie under to ſatisfie God our ſelves, but becauſe we have always Reaſon to fear that we are far from having ſatisfied occording to our Obligations, we ſhould be Enemies to our ſelves, if we ſhould not have recourſe to the Favours and Indulgences of the Church; which are deſign'd to aid thoſe who have a good Will, and do endeavour to ſatisfie for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to quit their Score, and to ſupply their Infirmities. Now theſe Satisfactions of the Saints, which make up the Fund of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Treaſure of the Church are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd to be increas'd to a mighty Sum and Heap, tho' an inviſible one, by any Works, eſpecially of Supererogation. And ſo the vows of the Religious Orders, of Poverty, Chaſtity, and Obedience to ſuch and ſuch auſtere Rules of living, are things accounted mightily merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. And then, if the Treaſure of the Church be mightily furniſh'd from the meritorious and ſatisfactory Fopperies of the Religious Orders, it is but reaſonable that the Pope ſhould grant Indulgences, that is, Communications of theſe Merits and Satisfactions to be obtain'd at their Altars and Chappels. But methinks, too, it ſeems not a little hard, or perhaps unjuſt, that every Order ſhould not have the keeping and diſpenſing of their own Merits and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that they muſt depend upon the Pope for the Diſpoſal of what is their own, or work to enlarge his Treaſure, and have none of their own to diſpoſe of, without his leave: <hi>Sic vos non vobis fertis aratra boves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall obſerve in the following Relation, that the Extent or Duration of the Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94187:61"/> granted to ſeveral Performances, is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; ſome being granted for a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Days, more or leſs; ſome again are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Plenary Indulgences;</hi> the Explication of this matter I ſhall give here once for all in their own Words: <q>Through an Indulgence of forty days, ſay they, men obtain the Forgiveneſs of the Penalty due for their Sins, all at once, as if they had truly done the Penance of forty days, according to the ancient Uſage of the holy Church. An Indulgence for a Year is a Forgiveneſs of Penalty ſo great as a Man could merit by doing penance for a whole Year. A Plenary Indulgence is the Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all Penalty that a Man owes for his Sins: ſo that he who hath obtain'd a Plenary Indulgence, if it were ſo that he ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately die before he fall again into Sin, he ſhould go ſtraight to Heaven, without being oblig'd to ſuffer in the Fire of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now obſerve how the Cheat of all this may be diſcern'd, and upon a little Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the matter we ſhall find that this whole Frame of Stuff is a politick Engine to keep the People in Awe and Subjection to the Pope, and to hold the ſeveral numerous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or rather Regiments of ſuperfluous Prieſts in good pay, and to pay them too with other Peoples Money. In the firſt place we may obſerve, 'tis well known to thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Hiſtory and Diſcipline of the primitive Church; that they did indeed injoyn publick Penance for thoſe who were guilty of publick and notorious Crimes, which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd them to endure and fulfil before they would admit them, after ſuch Faults, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94187:62"/> of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. But theſe Penances were not deſign'd to ſatisfy the divine Juſtice for the Sins committed, but to give the Church and the Publick, Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and evident Proof of the Sincerity and Truth of their Repentance. And when the time of theſe Penances was ſhortned, which was the uſual Indulgence of the Primitive Church, it was becauſe the Circumſtances ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the Church before the time appointed was all ſpent, that the Penitent was truly ſuch, and was come to a due Senſe and Deteſtation of his Fault: Or elſe it was ſhortned becauſe the Perſon was likely to die within the time prefixed. In which caſe alſo he having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Task of Pennance, was, at the point of Death, admitted to partake of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his Conſolation and Support in that ſad Hour. Thus was the matter managed in the primitive Church.</p>
               <p>And 'tis well known alſo by thoſe who are acquainted with the State and Management of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at preſent, that thoſe good Men who would revive the ancient Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and do require the Evidences of a true Repentance before they admit People to that Sacrament, are hated and perſecuted by the prevailing Faction in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of the Jeſuits; and revil'd and reproach'd with the Names of <hi>Janſeniſts, Arnaldiſts, Novators, Rigouriſts,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Among others who beſtow upon them theſe hated Names, the famous Traveller <hi>Hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>epin,</hi> whoſe Brains were bewildred in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of <hi>America;</hi> if he ever had any, has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to ſignalize himſelf in a Railing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94187:62"/> Book againſt them, which is full as wiſe as his Travels, and perhaps the Relations of it much about as true.</p>
               <p>Again, we may obſerve this Variation in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the primitive Church. The primitive Church was to have the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or give the Indulgence before the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: But in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> 'tis always expreſs'd and and requir'd as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of enjoying the Indulgence, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall have firſt confeſs'd, and receiv'd the Communion. The plain Reaſon of this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Offering at receiving of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is the chief thing which the Indulgence is granted for, and muſt be attain'd by. And the primitive Church never pretended by her Indulgence to relax the Pains of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or to deliver any from it; for they knew nothing of any ſuch place or State, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have invented.</p>
               <p>Further, let us obſerve, That the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> confeſſes, as indeed he is forced to do, by the Evidence of holy Scripture, That the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Death, are a full Satisfaction to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice for the Sins of Men. But from hence we may conclude, That at leaſt there can be no <hi>need</hi> of Humane Satisfactions, or that we muſt ſuffer ſevere penalties to ſatisfie for our Sins. The Juſtice of God cannot be ſaid to require more than is neceſſary, unleſs he be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unjuſtly accus'd. But if Chriſt has done all in this matter, more than all is more than need to be; a full Satisfaction muſt be enough, and all. Therefore whatever other Reaſons
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94187:63"/> there may have been for God's laying tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Afflictions on Good Men, notwithſtanding that he has pardon'd their ſins, they are not laid upon them for any Satisfaction to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice. If the ſuffering of theſe were the neceſſary and requir'd Condition of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in the Satisfaction of Chriſt Jeſus, yet it were not proper to call them Satisfactions to the Divine Juſtice for our ſins. He therefore in this Explication of the matter, goes beſide the true Doctrine of his Church, and gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Reaſon for theſe temporal puniſhments. Beſides, the Holy Scripture no where teaches this Doctrine of his: it ſays, <hi>By Grace we are ſaved,</hi> even through the Merits and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt, not by any penal Works of our own. And it is no where propos'd as a Condition of our partaking in the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt, that we muſt pay a part of the Satisfaction due, for our ſelves. If the Goodneſs of God, in condeſcenſion to our Weakneſs, is content that we ſhould ſatisfie for one another, as Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays: Why may we not believe that the Goodneſs of God for that Reaſon will accept of, and content himſelf with the Sufferings and Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt for us all? which indeed the Scripture plainly teaches, and we juſtly believe he has done.</p>
               <p>Further, the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> has been forced in his Explaining their Doctrine, in theſe matters, to deſtroy it; as indeed it does, like other Errors, deſtroy it ſelf: To make Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Indulgences, and keep up the Trade of them, he has evidently taken away what he calls the Foundation of Indulgences, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94187:63"/> the Treaſure of the Church, ſo far as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Saints are concern'd in it. He ſays, That Men ought, after all that they have done, in order to ſatisfie for their ſins, to fear ſtill that they have fallen ſhort of the full Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for themſelves, and therefore they muſt run from place to place to obtain the Benefit of Indulgences. But then, if any ought to fear this for themſelves, all ought to fear it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves. And if this be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, all muſt ſubmit to, and believe it; ſo that after all their pretended Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogations, thoſe of the Religious Orders ought to fear that they have not made Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction enough for themſelves. If <hi>they</hi> ought to fear this, <hi>others</hi> may fear it too, as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>thoſe Monks,</hi> as concerning <hi>themſelves:</hi> And then <hi>all</hi> may juſtly fear that there is no ſuch a Treaſure of Merits and Satisfactions from their penal and laborious Satisfactions, as is pretended. For he that may be fear'd not to have done enough for <hi>himſelf,</hi> may be more juſtly fear'd not to have done enough for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others.</hi> He that has not enough for himſelf, has none to ſpare. But the Scripture evidently determines this matter beyond all Contradiction, by deſtroying the vain Opinion of Supererogations: it teaches us evidently, That no man in this life can perfectly fulfil what he is oblig'd to by the Law of God; and for that Reaſon we all need the Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, in order to find Acceptance with God. The great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> renounces his own Righteouſneſs <hi>(Philip.</hi> 3. 9.) and ſays plainly, That he could not in this Life pretend to be perfect, in the 12th.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94187:64"/> 
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> The Apoſtle St. <hi>James,</hi> of himſelf and all Chriſtians, in common, ſays, <hi>In many things we offend all</hi> (James 3. 2.) The Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> includes himſelf alſo with all Chriſtians, and ſays, <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us,</hi> (1 Epiſt. Chap. 1. v. 8.) But if no man can perform all that he is oblig'd to do, certainly no man can do more than that. Further, No Man, nor Company of Men can make a full Satisfaction by all the penal Works which they can do in this Life, but after all, every Man muſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Doctrine, go to Purgatory; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the making Satisfaction for ſin, ſo as to eſcape the Puniſhment due, is the giving ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inſtead of that Puniſhment which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent: But they repreſent the Pains of Purgatory ſo much more grievous and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than all that can be endur'd in this Life, that no Penalties endur'd here, can be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to them; therefore none can excuſe a man's ſelf from going to Purgatory, therefore they cannot be of Value ſufficienty to excuſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from it; and then the Pope's Indulgences and the Privilege of delivering Souls out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, granted to ſuch and ſuch laborious Tasks of Devotion, or chargeable Charities, are an evident Cheat, and good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>As for Purgatory, it may be ſaid, the holy <note place="margin">Purgatory.</note> Scripture ſpeaks indeed of God's viſiting the Iniquities of his People with a Rod, and their Tranſgreſſions with Stripes, even at the ſame time when he ſays, <hi>His loving Kindneſs he will not utterly take from them.</hi> But theſe Afflictions are conſtantly there referr'd to this preſent
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94187:64"/> Life; and the Scripture ſpeaks of no ſufferings after it, but what the damned and reprobate ſhall endure in Puniſhment of their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Afflictions of this Life are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as deſign'd to correct and amend thoſe who are exercis'd with them, not for the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Divine Juſtice: They are <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal,</hi> not <hi>Penal,</hi> Diſpenſations; the Exerciſes of <hi>Wiſe Mercy,</hi> eſpecially upon thoſe who have repented of their Sins, and are forgiven, not the Exerciſes of <hi>Avenging Juſtice.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evidently contradicts the Opinion of a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tormenting Purgatory after Death, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting. that all who die in Faith and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, that is, all good Men, and ſuch whom the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſend to Purgatory, do go immediately upon their Deceaſe, to a Place and State of Bliſs. <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead</hi> (ſays St. <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 14. 13.) <hi>who die in the Lord, for they reſt from their Labours, and their Works follow them.</hi> They have no more to do to obtain their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, no terrible Torments to endure with the Spirit of Humility and Patience, not the hardeſt Work that ever they had to do, as the enduring of Purgatory would be; but their Works <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> follow them, what they have done they ſhall immediately find does redound now to their Joy and Reward. And 'tis to be obſerv'd from the Context, that the Apoſtle ſays this of thoſe good Men who ſhould be dead before thoſe times of Perſecution which he there threatens the Church with, and ſo they would eſcape the Martyrdom which muſt fall upon many in thoſe times: Theſe he pronounces Bleſſed after Death; but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will allow none to be ſo, but thoſe good Men who d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Martyrs.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:94187:65"/>
               <p>We may obſerve another Abſurdity in this Doctrine: They ſay, That altho' Mortal Sins are pardon'd upon Confeſſion and true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Abſolution, and good men who live free from ſuch ſhall never be condemn'd for what they have formerly committed; yet they being liable to Sins of Ignorance or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe will be inevitably liable to ſome temporal pain to ſatisfie for theſe which they call Venial Sins, and they muſt pay that Satisfaction to the utmoſt Farthing. That is to ſay, Mortal Sins are pardonable, the whole Puniſhment due to them may be remitted, that is, Mortal Sins are not mortal: But on the other hand, Venial, that is, pardonable Sins are not pardonable, but the whole Puniſhment due to them muſt be endur'd. If we ſhould follow their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine on theſe points through all the Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Self-contradictions it includes, we ſhould digreſs too far out of our way; let us therefore now return to the Courſe of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which is deſign'd chiefly to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Practices amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The fears of this imaginary Fire are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly kept up among the deluded People by the moſt frightful Repreſentations of it that can be invented. I remember a Story I have read to this purpoſe in the Jeſuite <hi>Euſebius Nie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rembergius</hi>'s Book concerning the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Temporal and Eternal: This I ſhall relate here, becauſe 'tis not very long, for a Specimen of their Management in this matter. A certain perſon, ſays he, lay ſick of ſome painful wracking Diſeaſes which made his Life a tedious Burden to him, ſo that he wiſh'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die than to endure ſuch Torments.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94187:65"/> Upon this an Angel was ſent to tell him, he muſt yet ſuffer more for the ſatisfaction for his Sins, but he might chuſe whether he would lie two Years more in this Torment and Miſery in this World, or lie three Days in the Fire of Purgatory. The wretched man, very ſenſible of preſent miſery, but not knowing what he was about to undergo, choſe to lie three Days in Purgatory; ſo he was immediately ſent thither. When he had been there the ſpace of 24. Hours the Angel came to make him a Viſit, and ask him, I ſuppoſe, how he lik'd his warm Lodging. The miſerable man was now almoſt beſide himſelf with the exceſs of Torments which he endur'd, and fell upon the Angel with Reproaches, as having cheated and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon him with Lyes. You told me, ſaid he, I ſhould lie here but three Days, and I have been a Year here already, and muſt I now endure it yet longer? The Angel gave him good words, aſſur'd him he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and that he had not been here the whole ſpace of a Day; and ſince he found it ſo intolerable, he ſaid, he might if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to his Habitation on Earth, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure there the remaining two Years of wrack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains from his former Diſeaſes. The poor man, with greateſt joy, accepted the offer, and return'd to his torments on Earth; and told this Story to I know not whom.</p>
               <p>The Fears thus rais'd inhance the Rate and Value of Indulgences which pretend to remit the Puniſhments and Satisfactions due for Sin, and ſo to exempt from, or mightily alleviate the pains of Purgatory: And how much ſoever theſe Indulgences are multiplyed, and whatever
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94187:66"/> muſt be done to obtain them, they will ſtill be follow'd by crouds of People, ſo long as this Fable obtains belief, who will think they can never be too ſafe from falling into this terrible Fire. By this Doctrine of Purgatory they are <note place="margin">Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Death.</note> frighted into ſeveral Fraternities which pretend to be erected particularly in order to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a happy Death. Such is the Aſſociation of the Holy Guardian Angels for that purpoſe, of which I ſhall have ſomething more to ſay in another place. Such too is the Brotherhood of the Name and to the Honour of the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maid <hi>Mary,</hi> and her Bridegroom <hi>Joſeph;</hi> eſtabliſh'd and join'd to the Fathers the <hi>Carmelites</hi> at <hi>Antwerp;</hi> which, in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of it, is ſaid to have been erected <hi>for promoting the Service</hi> of the Mother Ever-Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and her Bridegroom St. <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and to quicken Chriſtian People to the following of their Vertues and Example: Alſo for the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Interceſſion particularly to obtain thereby a happy Death, and the Graces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to neceſſary: And there is this Prayer fram'd which all the Brothers and Siſters of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are oblig'd to ſay at their entring themſelves into this Society.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of God and Virgin! I chuſe you and your good Bridegroom St.</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph <hi>this Day for my Patrons and Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and I ſteadily purpoſe that I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſake you; that I will never do or ſay any thing againſt you, nor will I ever ſuffer that any under my Authority ſhall act any thing contrary to your Honour. Therefore I pray you receive me to be your perpetual</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:94187:66"/> 
                  <hi>Servant: Aſſiſt me in all my Works, and forſake me not in the Hour of my Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſure is enough in all Conſcience to the Honour of theſe Saints, and it cannot, I think, well be imagin'd how more than this could be ſaid to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. Certainly the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Mediatours to the higheſt degree is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them; they are particularly choſen for this; the perſon devotes himſelf to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; promiſes ſolemnly never to forſake it; ſeeks their Aſſiſtance in all he does, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his Death. Thus is moſt evidently the Honour due to God alone given to Creatures, I mean that which is due to God the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And who can be perſwaded that this Prayer is made only with the Spirit of Charity, as we deſire our Brethren on Earth to pray for us. Another Fraternity is erected to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo; which belongs to the Jeſuits Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at <hi>Ghent,</hi> under the Name of the Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the holy Death-pangs of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt dying on the Croſs, and of his moſt holy Mother ſuffering together with him under the Croſs, in order to obtain a happy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Death.</p>
               <p>There is alſo erected at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Cathedral Church there, a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity under the Name of the Brotherhood of the Dead, who are to take eſpecial care for the relief of the Dead, and this is honour'd with many choice Indulgences.

They are ſpread into ſeveral Countries. This Abby is as well worth ſeeing as any in the Town: I know not what particular ſtock of Indulgences they have, but they are very rich here and every where; 'tis probable they will admit none into their Order but who are ſo. They have here at preſent a large and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Houſe which is dedicated to St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> the Arch-Angel. It ſtands very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly on the South-ſide of the Town near the River. The Chappel is well ſtor'd with very valuable Paintings. In one large Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Wall is a Draught with a multitude of Figures in it, and they not very ſmall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this they ſay repreſents all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of our Saviour. Their Dining-room has admirable Paintings in it; and their Garden is beautiful, and well furniſh'd with Flowers in their ſeaſon, and Bay-trees, and other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of a Garden. Beſides this place they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94187:69"/> have a very delightful Country-ſeat at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a little Walk from the City. We may eaſily obſerve, that theſe good People, like the reſt of the Religious Orders, who are rich, live in great Eaſe and Plenty, and have the beſt Enjoyment of the World; which they renounce and retire from but as <hi>La Fountain</hi>'s Religious Rat did, when ſhe had eat her ſelf a Cell in a good choice <hi>Holland</hi> Cheeſe.</p>
               <p>Before we leave <hi>Antwerp</hi> we muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <note place="margin">Jeſuits.</note> to viſit the Jeſuits, whom all Travellers are commonly directed to in the firſt place. Beſides the common Arts of the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Orders to encreaſe their Wealth and Plenty while they pretend to renounce it all, theſe Fathers, as they will be call'd, increaſe their Intereſt and Wealth by the Schools which they every where hold. They have here a multitude of Scholars in a Grammar-School. In one Houſe are the Schools where they are taught; in another they board young Gentlemen, and ſuch as come from other Parts to them: And beſides theſe two they have a 3d Houſe which they call <hi>Domus Profeſſionis;</hi> in this the Order firſt ſettled at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and here Jeſuits beget and breed Jeſuits, for if they are Fathers they muſt have Children. This Order are as black as the other are white; for their Habit is all Black without one ſcrap of White to be ſeen. Two of this Order came firſt to <hi>Antwerp</hi> in the Year 1652; but the Civil Wars coming on they left it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for a while and return'd when things were quiet. In the Year 1585 they obtain'd of the Senate a Decree which gave them poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94187:70"/> of the large Houſe laſt mention'd, which had been built at the publick charge of the City, at firſt, for the Entertainment of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Vth: Afterwards it was lent to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company of Merchants who reſided in this City. Their Chappel here is indeed extreamly rich and fine. The Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece is the nobleſt piece of Architecture that one ſhall eaſily meet with; on it there is this Inſcription <hi>Chriſto Deo, Virgini Deiparae, B. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio Loyolae Societatis Autori, Senatus, populuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Antwerpienſis publico &amp; privato aere ponere voluit.</hi> It is adorn'd with Statues of the Saints of their Order, and to be ſure in the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable place is that of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Within, the Floor is laid with fine black and white Marble; the Pillars that ſupport the Galleries which run all the length of the two ſide Iſles of the Chappel are white Marble, and go up to the Arch which is over the middle Iſle. That Arch looks very great, is full of Carv'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work and Guilding, and is Wainſcot painted with the Colour of the Marble Pillars. The Partition or Rail which runs croſs the great Iſle before the High Altar is alſo white Marble, the whole piece is carv'd ſo that one can look through in many places, and is carv'd into the Figures of Cupids, and Vines, and Flowers. They have here ſeveral Pictures of great value of <hi>Rubens</hi>'s Work; and that not only at the Altars, which I think are not above 4 or 5 in all below, and I think two above in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries; but the Ceiling alſo over the two Iſles which is flat on both ſides is full of very curious Paintings plac'd in ſo many Squares. Their Altars here are alway very fine, but on high
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94187:70"/> Days they make ſhow of abundance of Riches at them in tall Silver Candleſticks, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and other things of Silver or Silver guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the very rich Copes of the Prieſts that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate at them add to the Wordly Pomp and Splendour.</p>
               <p>As one comes out of the Chappel, at the Door which leads into the Houſe, there ſtands in a little Room, a large ſort of a Box which fills almoſt half the Room. In this are ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Edges cloſe by one another the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Altars, which ſtand before them from the top to the Ground. I could never hear whether they have a particular Name for theſe things, or not, but they are of common Uſe in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> their Altars are cover'd with Linen which covers all the top of the Table, and hangs down at the two ends to the Ground; ſometimes at the end of that Linen they will have a deep rich Lace, but theſe are ſome rich Silks, and the like, ſtretch'd upon a Frame of a convenient Size, and ſet cloſe before the Altar, ſo as to ſeem of a piece with it; and the Figures upon them are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuited to the Holiday they celebrate; ſo they have ſeveral of theſe things for ſeveral Days. There were in this great Box or Preſs, I believe, about thirty of theſe things, and all different in ſome reſpects, from one another; ſome of them were Cloth of Silver, or Silver mixed with Gold; ſome were Velvet or Satti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94187:71"/> is, along the top, and down at the ends; ſome had laid acroſs them a deep Gold-Fringe which run from the one end to the other at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of about a Foot from the top; ſome were richly embroider'd with Gold and Silver in the place of Lace. Some were all over em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd with Silver and Gold, and ſome with Silk, and the Stalks of the Embroidery, I think of more than one, were ſet with a multitude of Pearls; one was of flower'd Silk with a great many ſmall Flowers in it, and the Eye of every Flower was a ſmall Ruby, there muſt be a great many ſcores of Rubies in the whole piece. One had a great deal of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Needle-work of divers Colours in Silk, and in a large Oval in the middle of it was a ſmall Picture of an handſome Lady, at full length, whom the Jeſuit that ſhow'd theſe things, call'd the Lady of <hi>Princen-Land</hi> her ſelf, and I ſuppoſe he told ſome of their Religion, whom he ſpoke ſoftly to, that ſhe had preſented this. To provide and maintain all this Pomp and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, this Church of theirs is endow'd (as we may ſay, for theſe things are in the nature, and have the effect of Revenues) with a multitude of Plenary and other Indulgences to be obtain'd throughout the whole Year. They have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences to be obtain'd on the Feſtivals of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pretended Saints of their own Order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what they have on the days of other Saints.

               <p>Here we ſee the Mediation of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> applied to for the Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit, and they profeſs to expect the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of theſe thereby; and that at a time when the Chriſtian Church has been wont to celebrate the Aſcenſion of our bleſſed Saviour into Heaven, who promiſed upon his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſend the Holy Spirit upon his Apoſtles and Followers. So that as true Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would much more properly and juſtly direct us at this time to pray for that promiſe of our Saviour to be fulfill'd upon us in ſuch a meaſure as may be neceſſary to our Salvation, and to betake our ſelves to the Interceſſion of Jeſus, who ever lives to make Interceſſion for us. This <hi>Marian</hi> Religion diverts its miſerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Votaries from him, and teaches them to pray for theſe greateſt Bleſſings, and to expect them through the Mediation of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94187:73"/> Days. Of theſe we muſt give ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>They have joyn'd to them a Sodality or Brotherhood of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, as they ſay, with many Indulgences and Favours: Particularly the Popes have granted to this Fraternity all the Indulgences belonging to the Stations at <hi>Rome,</hi> the which all of the Sodality may enjoy for the Reading ſeven <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> and ſeven <hi>Ave Mary's</hi> in the Church of the Society, or in the Chappel of the Sodality upon particular days of every Month, which are ſpecified in the Book of the Ordinances of this Sodality, with the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences that are thus to be obtain'd on thoſe Days: Every Month of the Year has ſeveral of them; and one ſees on many Days a Plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Indulgence promiſed; on others a thouſand Years of Indulgence, on others forty thouſand years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are mighty Encouragements to be of this Sodality, and to come to theſe places to perform this Devotion, and to be ſure (which is the chief End of all) to drop here their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, without which, it is a Maxim, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence may be obtain'd. The Prayer which they teach the People to make when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves into this Fraternity, after the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual manner runs thus:
<q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of God and Virgin, I</hi> N.

                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:94187:73"/> 
                        <hi>you therefore receive me to be</hi> your perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Servant; <hi>aſſiſt me in all my Works, and forſake me not in the Hour of my Death.</hi>
                     </p>

               </p>
               <p>The Company preſent, as receiving the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon entring, ſhall ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee 'tis a very common and uſual thing with the wretched People in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to dedicate and devote themſelves ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly to ſerve and honour their Fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; that is, to give God's Incommunicable Glory to others than himſelf. And theſe are not Exceſſes of Devotion which the ignorant People do of themſelves run into, but they are things which they are led and exhorted, and urg'd to do by their Guides, and which are encourag'd and recommended by Biſhops and Popes, by the Indulgences which they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour theſe Fraternities with. Let us hear what the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mechlin</hi> thinks fit to ſay of theſe matters in his Circular Letter. <q>The Sodalities or Fraternities (ſays he) which are erected to her Honour (meaning the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary)</hi> I will, and recommend to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, together with the Privileges and Immunities granted them by the Favour of Popes and Biſhops, and that the People be invited, who have not yet done it, to give their Names to them; that new Sodalities be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and thoſe that are fallen be reſtor'd. He that touches theſe, let him know, that he touches the Apple of our Eye.</q> This I eaſily believe, for theſe are things which ſerve to confirm the People in their Errors, to continue
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94187:74"/> their Slavery, and to provide for a number of idle, uſeleſs Prieſts, perhaps beyond any other Intrigues whatever.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall go on to repreſent a little of their Management of the Sodalities which belong to this Houſe of Jeſuits, as it may be ſeen in the Publications of the Plenary Indulgences follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being reſolv'd to keep ſtrictly through this whole Relation to the publick and authentick Accounts which they give of themſelves, and their abominable Practices.</p>

This ſerv'd, and we went on board the Boat at Four a Clock in the Afternoon, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we could come to the Canal of <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> with Light enough to ſee that end where we ſhould enter upon it, and ſo to ſee what it is, for 'tis all alike. At going on Board this Boat we paid for each perſon eighteen Stivers and receiv'd a ſmall Leaden Ticket mark'd with <hi>A</hi> for <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and a Figure ſignifying the day of the Month. We had the Wind ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair but there was but little of it. Our Courſe up the <hi>Schelde</hi> continued almoſt half the way to <hi>Dendermond.</hi> We obſerv'd the Country on our right ſide as we went up the River, which is <hi>Flanders,</hi> to lie all flat, and it afforded us no Proſpect, but of ſome rows of Trees at a diſtance. In ſome places our ſight on that ſide was confin'd by a high Dyke or Bank, rais'd to defend the Country within from the Inundations of the River. But on the other ſide, which is the Province of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> we had a very pleaſant Proſpect: For the Ground riſes gradually and pretty high in ſome places, and ſo ſhews it ſelf to a great diſtance. And it ſhows a rich enclos'd Country divided
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94187:78"/> into Paſtures, Corn-fields, Gardens and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards. When we left the <hi>Schelde</hi> we turn'd <note place="margin">Rupell. R.</note> on our left-ſide into another River call'd the <hi>Rupell,</hi> over againſt a place in <hi>Flanders</hi> which from its being oppoſite to the Mouth of this River is call'd <hi>Rupelmonde.</hi> The <hi>Rupell</hi> is a conjunction of three little Rivers of <hi>Brabant,</hi> the <hi>Neethe,</hi> the <hi>Dyle,</hi> and the <hi>Demer.</hi> The <hi>Dyle</hi> coming down from <hi>Louvain</hi> joins the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> between <hi>Louvain</hi> and <hi>Mechlin:</hi> They run together under the Name of the <hi>Dyle</hi> to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Village call'd <hi>Rumpſt</hi> below <hi>Mechlin,</hi> where they joyn the <hi>Neethe,</hi> and from thence the whole Stream to the <hi>Schelde</hi> has the Name of the <hi>Rupell.</hi> In this we ſail'd upwards, almoſt as far as it bears that Name, to a Village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Willibroeck</hi> where the Canal of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters this River, and where we were to leave this our Sailing-Veſſel and to go into the <hi>Trech-Schuyt</hi> or Drawn-boat which paſſes upon that Canal. About Sun-ſet we arriv'd at this place, <note place="margin">Canal of Br.</note> went on Board the <hi>Trech-Schuyt,</hi> and in leſs than a quarter of an Hour went on. This is a very large and long Boat divided into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rooms. I believe we could not be leſs than an hundred Paſſengers in the ſeveral parts of it. We thought it neceſſary to be under cover in the Night, and did not care to be of the Company in the common part of the Boat, and therefore we went into the Roof, which is a clean convenient Room at the Stern end of the Boat, where we ſate among the cleaneſt of the Paſſengers. But for this we paid at ſeveral times in the ſeveral Boats, reckoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, I think, what we paid in the Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Ship to <hi>Willibroeck,</hi> for each perſon ſeven
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94187:79"/> Stivers and a half. We chang'd our Boat on the Canal four times, for there are on it five Sluces. One is at the entrance of it into the <hi>Rupell,</hi> and the reſt were in our way. The Canal is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rows of Trees on the ſides of it: It runs always ſtrait for a good way together. We had ſometimes a very conſiderable Aſcent to mount at the Sluces we came to, when we walk'd from one <hi>Schuyt</hi> to another. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of it run level, but the Aſcents are at the Sluces: And there is ſo much A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent in the whole, that 'tis reckon'd the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Water of the Canall at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> is forty Feet higher in a direct perpendicular than it is at <hi>Willibroeck.</hi> The Sluces are not open'd for theſe <hi>Trech-Schuytes</hi> becauſe they carry only Paſſengers, who can convey them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from one <hi>Schuyt</hi> to another: But they are open'd for Ships loaden with Goods, of which a great many come up through this Canal to <hi>Bruſſels:</hi> We paſs'd by, and met ſeveral in our Paſſage. The chief Author, or at leaſt the Promoter, of this Magnificent and moſt uſeful Work is ſaid to have been <hi>Johannes Locquenginius, Locquenginii, Berchemii &amp; quelbergiae Dominus:</hi> The Judge for that time of the Civil Cauſes at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> The Deſign was form'd by his Anceſtors in the time of <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> the Aunt of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, whom that Emperour made Governeſs of theſe Countries. But it was not ſet about till towards the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was finiſh'd in the Year 1560. The Charge of it is reckon'd to amount to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Five hundred thouſand Crowns. We were five Hours on this Canal, and the length
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94187:79"/> of it is reckon'd to be ſo many Leagues. We went the length of three Mile <hi>Engliſh</hi> in an Hour, which is the common pace of the <hi>Trech-Schuyts,</hi> and were drawn with two Horſes. When we came to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> we deliver'd our Tickets, and were diſmiſs'd without farther payment. We lay down in a Houſe without the City till Morning becauſe the Gates were ſhut, and none could be admitted to go in.</p>

               <p>THis City by the Latins call'd <hi>Bruxella,</hi> by the French <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> and by the People of the Country <hi>Bruſſel,</hi> is alſo very Ancient, and the beginnings of it are obſcure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. It pretends to have been a City from about the Year of our Lord 974; and to have had its utmoſt encreaſe, and preſent extent from the Year 1369. It is ſituate, part of it, on the ſide of a little Hill which it runs up to the top of, and part in a Valley. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it from what it was at firſt is very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by the Remainders of the old and firſt Wall, which with ſome of its Ports is ſtill ſtanding, and appears in ſeveral places of the City. The outermoſt Wall was begun to be built in the Year 1357, and was finiſh'd in the Year 1369. The Compaſs of this Wall is ſaid to be leſs than of that of <hi>Louvain</hi> by 200 Paces; but this City within is more built than that, and therefore is reckon'd to contain more People. It ſeems indeed to be very full of People. The neweſt Wall has ſeven Ports, and on that ſide which is at the top of the Hill
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94187:80"/> is a high round Brick Building which is a Watch-Tower, from whence they can look over all the City and far about in the Country. The Bombarding of the <hi>French</hi> in the Year 1695 fell moſt upon the Inner City, though indeed it deſtroy'd the greateſt part of that. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Deſign lodg'd not far from the Court near a large and good old Building which belongs to our King, and is call'd the Palace of <hi>Naſſau:</hi> This is included in the Inner City, but eſcap'd the Bombarding. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſituate in a rich and plentiful Country, and ſtands very Airy and Healthy. There is on one ſide of it a large Tract of Meadows, but 'tis chiefly encompaſs'd with Hills that riſe gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up and have upon them wide open Fields of Plough'd Ground, the Soil' being very fit for Corn. The Country here is ſo very plentiful that in time of Peace it affords Proviſion for the greateſt Concourſe of People. In the time of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, 'tis ſaid there came together at once to this City 7 Crown'd Heads, beſides ſeveral other leſſer Sovereign Princes, and all of them were attended with a great Retinue. They were reckon'd to bring together 18000 Horſes, yet there was no want of Proviſion for this great Company. Between the two Walls of the City are the Court or Palace with the Park belonging to it; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces alſo of ſeveral of the Nobility of theſe Countries, beſides Gardens of the Citizens, and ſome Meadows which make the City the more Healthy and Pleaſant.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Senne,</hi> which riſes in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Hainault,</hi> on that ſide next to <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> runs through the lower part of this City.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94187:80"/> It divides it ſelf into two Channels a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it enters the City, and then comes in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at an equal diſtance on each ſide the Port of <hi>Anderlecht.</hi> It makes ſeveral Iſlands in the City, uniting and dividing its Streams ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times. It runs on in <hi>Brabant</hi> to <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorde,</hi> a little Town upon the Canal, and from thence falls into the <hi>Dyle</hi> below <hi>Mech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi> This little River affords the Water which furniſhes the great Canal. This City is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully furniſh'd beſide with Springs of Water, which feed ſome publick Fountains, and ſerve alſo the private Houſes, and it is as good Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as is to be met with perhaps in any of the Countries of <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <hi>Bruſſels</hi> has long been, and ſtill is the Seat of the Chancery of <hi>Brabant.</hi> The Office of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor is a great Dignity, and of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for he is reckon'd, in effect, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and a ſort of Deputy to the Duke himſelf. Other Courts alſo to which all this Province come upon ſeveral Occaſions, are held here. There is in this City likewiſe an Eccleſiaſtical Court for the Dioceſs of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> to which all Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical come, which do happen within that part of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that runs into <hi>Brabant.</hi> Beſides theſe things which occaſion many People to come hither, in theſe latter times, <hi>Bruſſels</hi> has been the Seat and uſual Reſidence of the Governour of the <hi>Belgick Provinces,</hi> who has here kept his Court, which has occaſion'd a Concourſe of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Nobility and Gentry of theſe Countries, and the building ſo many Houſes for them, as there are here. It has Fifty two Colledges, as they are call'd, of Tradeſmen, which we
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94187:81"/> in <hi>London</hi> call Companies, and theſe are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into Nine Parts, which are called here the <hi>Nations.</hi> At <hi>Bruſſels</hi> the Art of making Tapeſtry now flouriſhes, and ſome of the beſt in the World is made here; ſome of the choice of which is ſeen in the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Apartments in the Palace: It is thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be the Furniture alſo of ſome of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Rooms in the Palaces of other Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi>

He is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of unwearied Activity and Vigour, of a great Spirit, has large Dominions, and perhaps much larger Hopes. He was abſent when we were here, at his laborious Pleaſures of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which he takes great Delight, ſo we could not ſee him.</p>
               <p>The Palace ſtands in ſome of the higheſt part of the City. It is built round a very large Court: Behind it is a Deſcent of a great many Steps to the Gardens which lie in a little Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley between that and the Park. There is an open Gallery of a good length on this ſide, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long which ſtands ſeveral Stone-Statues which repreſent ſome of the Ancient Dukes of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</hi> From the Garden-Wall the Ground ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes very ſteep, and ſhows the Park above it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94187:81"/> to the loweſt Rooms of the Palace. The Park is planted with Lime-Trees in Rows, and ſtock'd with Dear; there are in it ſome wild Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's of Rock-work, and all together affords a very pleaſant ſhort proſpect to the Rooms on this ſide of the Palace. We went out of the Park into a Garden where the Water-works are ſhown; thoſe we ſaw are in a long Stone-Building which ſtands in the Form of a Piazza: the inſide of which, with the Pillars and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on the Front of it, are cover'd with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Pearl, Sea-ſhels, pieces of cragged Stones, Sea-plants, and the like. The Water in one Diviſion within ſets on work ſeveral ſorts of Handicrafts men, as a Smith, a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, a Brace of Sawyers, and others. In another there is a pretty Caſcade of Water: in one there is an attempt of a perpetual Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which cannot be deſcrib'd ſo as to give a juſt Idea of it to one that has not ſeen it. In ſhort, there are two men ſet at the two ends of a Ballance: he at the left end, as they are before us, is heavier than he who is at the right end: Therefore he deſcends and lifts the other up. The other when lifted up holds a little Bucket to a ſmall Spout of Water which falls into it, and when that is full this man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes heavier by vertue of his Water than the other, and thereupon weighs the other up, but in deſcending he ſpills his Water and the other immediately brings him up again. While the Water is filling his Bucke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, a ſmall Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Ball ſlowly deſcends three rows of Wires, falling from one to the other, and at laſt drops into the Lap of the lower man; by that time it is there the man with the Bucket deſcends
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94187:82"/> with the weight of his Water, and then this man riſing carries up the Ball, and throws it upon the uppermoſt row of Wires; there are two Balls, and the matter is ſo order'd that one or other of them is always in motion. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diviſion a Duck drinks but without lifting her Head, I ſaw her empty ſeveral times a Shell of Mother of Pearl which the Servant held to her full of Water. There is one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine caſts out the Water in the common Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Start. Other Water-works there are which we could not ſee by reaſon of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the perſon that muſt ſhow them.</p>
               <p>The Stables belonging to the Palace are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magnificent, and capable of holding above an hundred Horſes. Over them is a large Chamber which they call the Armoury. Here are kept the Weapons and Armour uſed in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, but all that is here belong'd to Princes: Some to the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> who were the Sovereigns of theſe Provinces before they fell to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> There is the Armour of ſeveral Emperours; ſome very fine Armour of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Vth; the Armour of ſome of the Princes who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd theſe Countries under the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</hi> In ſome Preſſes here are kept the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Furniture belonging to the Electours beſt Coach. The Seats are of Scarlet Velvet very thick overlaid with an Embroidery of Gold, the Harneſs is cover'd with the ſame, I think, and alſo much embroider'd with Gold, the Buckles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are guilded, and there are many Taſſels of Gold and Silver-thred mingl'd, with a very deep Fringe.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:94187:82"/>
               <p>This City will be much the finer for having been Bombarded; for whereas before the Houſes were old and built for the moſt part with Timber, they will be now new, and built with Stone or Brick; and a great many ofthem are built after the new faſhion with Cantilivers at the top of the Front. The Fronts of the Houſes on the Great Market are built very fine, and of Stone, ſome White, ſome Blew. The Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work is carv'd into tall Pillars which reach from the bottom to the top of the Houſe, and the top is form'd into a handſome Arch; there are other Ornaments alſo in the Work, and of ſome Houſes a great deal of the Work is at proper places guilded. But it ſeems to leſſen ſomewhat the Beauty of all this Finery, that every Houſe has its own form of Architecture, and differs from its Neighbours: The Houſes being commonly very high even to the height of four or five good Stories, and yet but very narrow, the Architecture looks not well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd and too high for the Breadth. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of the Front of one of theſe Houſes is ſet a large Eſſigies of the preſent Governour the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> on Horſeback: It ſeems to be very good Work, and looks bold and brave; there is on the Pedeſtal an <hi>Elogium</hi> of this brave Prince but ſo ſet that it cannot eaſily be all read, it being very high. The City, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-houſe is repair'd, the Frontis-piece which is very fine and good Architecture ſuffer'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little from the Bombs: And I think the Tower which ſtands up from the middle of the Houſe with a large Image in Braſs at the top of it repreſenting St. <hi>Michael</hi> ſtanding upon the Dragon, eſcap'd them too: This Image is ſaid
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94187:83"/> to be fifteen Feet in height. Right againſt the Senate-houſe, with Front to Front, ſtands on the other ſide of the great Market the Shell of a very large Houſe, which ſeems by the Front yet remaining to have deſerv'd the Name of a Palace, as they have been wont to call it: This Houſe was built by a Baker of this City, I could not learn the Name of the Vain-glorious Fool. It was call'd to us now, <hi>the King's Houſe,</hi> as belonging to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Angel <hi>Michael</hi> is the reputed Guardian <note place="margin">Worſhip of Angels.</note> or Patron of this City. What kind Offices the Angels do for Mankind are done by God's Command and at his Direction and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But I know not any ground we have to take the liberty of chuſing whom we pleaſe of them for our Protectours: Nor can I find that it has ever been reveal'd to this People, that God has committed the care of their City to this particular Angel. I know not what particular Devotions they pay to this good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for his Protection, neither: But I know that the Scripture expreſsly forbids and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the Worſhip of Angels. An evident Text to this purpoſe we have in <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 18. It is worth taking notice upon this Occaſion what Sence the Jeſuit <hi>Menochius</hi> puts upon this Text of H. Scripture, becauſe he is forced by the Evidence of it to condemn his own Church. The Apoſtle, ſays he, does here condemn the Errour of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> That Heretick aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that God was Inacceſſible, that we have need of the holy Angels to go between him and us: We ought therefore to apply our ſelves to the Angels, to entreat them to intercede for us. The Sence of the place therefore ſays he is this:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94187:83"/> Whoever would ſeduce you by a feign'd Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, as if it were an Arrogance to pray to God immediately or to apply our ſelves to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and ſo would induce a falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Angels let him not be regarded. Tho' he reckon'd he had left the worſhip which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pays them ſafe, by putting in the word <hi>Falſe,</hi> yet he has evidently enough condemn'd both their worſhip of Angels and of Saints, ſo far as they are built upon this ground, that God, or our Saviour in his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is ſo much above us, that it becomes us not to addreſs immediately to him, but we ſhould rather engage ſome Inferiour Interceſſours to recommend us to God. This Plea in <hi>Simon Magus</hi> he condemns, and in ſo doing he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> too, which puts into the Peoples Mouths this very excuſe for their worſhip of Saints and Angels. And if the worſhip of Angels out of a pretended Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is here forbid, doubtleſs all worſhip of them is forbidden; for no other reaſon, that will go any further than this, can be aſſign'd for it. If Gratitude for good Offices receiv'd would juſtifie this, St. <hi>John</hi> had not been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to do it, by the Angel himſelf, who was the Meſſenger of the Revelations he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. The good man, like a ſincere and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd Writer confeſſes, that the weakneſs of Humane Nature had betray'd him into an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and that he had been ſo far tranſported by a Sence of the Favours which this Angel had oblig'd him with, that (as he ſays, <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>v.</hi> 22. 8.) <hi>He fell down to worſhip before the Feet of the Angel who had ſhow'd him thoſe things.</hi> But the Angel (as he ſays again in the 9th <hi>v.)</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94187:84"/> him the doing thus, ſaying, <hi>See thou do it not, for I am thy Fellow-Servant, and</hi> a Fellow-Servant <hi>of thy Brethren the Prophets, and of them that keep the Sayings of this Book. Worſhip thou God.</hi> The Angel knew of no Worſhip due or lawful to be paid to Creatures: The good Spirit therefore refus'd ſuch an extravagant Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of what he had, by God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Command, done for the Apoſtle. He directs St. <hi>John</hi> aright, and bids him worſhip God, and give him Thanks for the Benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. A good Angel would not take this Honour to himſelf, which he knew did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him. This Admonition, <hi>Worſhip God,</hi> as it is connected here, ſignifies plainly as much as to ſay, worſhip God alone, according to the Import of the firſt Commandment in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue. His Reaſon of forbidding the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to worſhip him, which was, that he was his Fellow-Servant, reaches evidently to the forbidding all Worſhip to be given either to Saints or Angels.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid thus much concerning the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Angels, I ſhall proceed to repreſent the Honour and Worſhip of them which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches and recommends to her People. I have met with Opportunity and Means to learn this from themſelves, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: that we may yet further under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how the Practices of that Church do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or rather diſagree with that moſt ſure and perfect Rule and Guide to Happineſs, the Holy Sciptures. There is a Fraternity erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and recommended among them in theſe Countries, under the Title of an Aſſociation in order to die well, under the Protection of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94187:84"/> the Guardian-Angels. This I ſhall give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, as what will afford us a Summary of their Doctrine and Practices in this matter.</p>
               <p>To recommend this Society the People are <note place="margin">Fraternity of the Guardian-Angels.</note> taught as follows. They ſay, the Angels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over all things here below; they have ſet one over the Element of Fire, tho' later Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have deſtroy'd his Kitchin; one over the Element of Water, whom they will have to be the Author of the Flux and Reflux of the Sea. They ſay every Nation has an Angel its particular Guardian; and that 'tis probable every City and Town has one of theſe Spirits for its Protector. And they confidently affirm, that every particular perſon has his Guardian-Angel, who is appointed to attend him.</p>
               <p>This Guardian-Angel, to whom they aſſign a great deal of other Drudgery and Attendance, they ſay is our Advocate at the point of Death againſt the Accuſations of the Devil; and that he pleads for us then, and reckons up on our behalf all the Alms, Faſtings, Confeſſions, Communions, Auſterities, Penances that we have ever done. And they tell pretty Stories relating to this matter; as, That St. <hi>John</hi> the Alms-giver, once throwing a Loaf at the Head of a rude and troubleſom Beggar, more out of Anger and Impatience, than out of Charity, the Angel pleaded for him, and obtain'd, that the Loaf made an Amends for the Impatience, and was put to the Account of his Charity for all that. And in the precious Annals of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>Francis</hi> 'tis ſaid, That the Guardian-Angel of a certain Gentleman who was dead without Confeſſion, tho' he had not confeſs'd himſelf in 20 years together, produced in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94187:85"/> two Bundles of Straw which he had once afforded to two of the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Order to ſerve them to ſleep upon; and putting theſe into the Ballance with the deſire which he had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his abominable Crimes, he gain'd his Cauſe. One might think this Duty of confeſſing is not worth much, if a few Straws could make an Amends for the neglect of it for ſo many years together. But when this is made ſo indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Duty as it is in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet an Act of Charity, as they call it, to the lazy, uſeleſs Religious, could countervail the Neglect of it, we may ſee how the Inſtructions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are contriv'd to promote a good Life. This indeed is an admirable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to bring the Wealth of the World into theſe pretended Religious Houſes, but no good Method to bring Men to Heaven. Theſe Guardian-Angels, they pretend, when any perſons are dead, do take a great deal of Care to ſollicit the Prayers of their Friends, and of other good People for them; and eſpecially do they endeavour particularly to procure Maſſes for the dead, or certain Communions; for there is nothing, they ſay, does ſo ſoon quench the great Flames of this Fire, as the Blood of the Lamb which we ſacrifice on the Altar. They ſay the B. <hi>John de la Croix</hi> convers'd ſo familiarly with his good Angel, that one day he brought him to his Chamber a conſecrated <hi>Hoſtie,</hi> to the end he ſhould receive it, to the Benefit of the poor Souls in Purgatory. <hi>I come,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>with an</hi> Hoſtie <hi>which I have taken from the Mouth of a Reprobate, who has given up his wretched Soul before he could ſwallow it: Do you,</hi> ſaid the Angel, <hi>receive it from my</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:94187:85"/> 
                  <hi>Hands, and offer this Victim to his Father for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the dead who are ſtill indebted to the Divine Juſtice. This St.</hi> John <hi>did receive, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, from the Hand of his dear Protector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſaid, There are no good things in the Order of Nature, which the Angels do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford their Clients; and there are no good things in the Order of Grace, which they do not ask, and infallibly obtain, if we ſecond their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Yea, we ſhall certainly poſſeſs the great Goods of the heavenly Glory by the Interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe faithful Friends, if we commit our ſelves to their Conduct. The Condition of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining theſe things from their Guardian-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, the People are taught, is, if they will ſerve him faithfully. The Honour which we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to render the Angels, is ſaid to be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the Care that we ought to have for our Salvation. And as much as we deſire to be ſav'd, with the ſame Degree of Ardour we ought to ſeek and ſecure the Favour of theſe bleſſed Spirits.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee now what Courſe the People are directed to take, in order to gain the Favour of theſe good Spirits, and their Aſſiſtance in all times of need. An extravagant honouring of them is urg'd for this purpoſe; and they teach, That they muſt be honour'd by our avoiding of all Wickedneſs, and by our Sufferance of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive Evils, and by our Prayers to them. The Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye do, do all to the Glory of God:</hi> But the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> teach, that theſe things ſorementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd may and muſt be done to the Honour of the Angels, and for their Honour, in order to obtain their Aſſiſtance eſpecially at
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94187:86"/> the Hour of Death. It is worth while to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what is propos'd as a Pattern to the World for the honouring of the Angels by Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance and Prayers.</p>
               <p>A certain nameleſs perſon, they tell us, who was devoted to the Angels, accuſtom'd himſelf to theſe following Sufferances in Honour of them. The firſt Mortification he underwent, was, That he very readily aroſe in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Bed. And they ſay <hi>John Cartera</hi> a Religious of the Company of Jeſus, was for two Years together depriv'd of the ſight of his good Angel, who had been wont to awake him every day at the due hour, for his having once loiter'd a little, and not riſen preſently. Another Mortification which he bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to, was, That being up, he immediately fell on his Knees before his Oratory, where he had an Image of the Angel-Guardian. He in the firſt place, then, thanked God for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which he had beſtow'd upon him; and, after he had paid his Reſpects to Jeſus, and to his Mother, he gave thanks to his good Angel for the Benefits which he had conferr'd upom him during the Night. He conjur'd him to hinder him from falling into any mortal Sin: He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to him all his Actions, to the end that <hi>he</hi> ſhould unite them to thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt: He pray'd <hi>him</hi> (that is, the Angel) to apply the Satisfaction of all his good Works, as of the Maſs, or the Chaplet to ſome Soul or other detain'd in the Fire of Purgatory. It is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very odd ſort of Notion to put Prayer and Acts of Devotion among the Works of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Sufferings; he is but in a very ill ſtate of Mind, and ſadly indiſpos'd to pray he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94187:86"/> muſt be, to whom it is grievous to do this: And I doubt thoſe Prayers he makes in that caſe, will find but little Favour or Acceptance. But this is the conſtant way of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to put their Tasks of Devotion among their Penances and Mortifications. We may obſerve here alſo, that the People are taught to depend upon the Angel for their Intereſt in the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Acceptance even of their good Works, and alſo to be kept from mortal Sin. Thus are the greateſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in this way of Worſhip diſir'd, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be obtain'd, not only by, but alſo from theſe Bleſſed Spirits, which is not a Reliance certainly upon their Interceſſion alone, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon themſelves for the good things we deſire, which is an Honour due to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>To proceed; 'Tis ſaid, That on every <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> which is the day particularly conſecrated to theſe glorious Spirits, from the Morning he girt himſelf with a Girdle which was made very uneaſie to him with ſharp Points of Iron turn'd towards his Body, and in the Evening he end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his day with a bloody Diſcipline. But be it known, that altho' the Superſtitions and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Rites of Religion, which the Devil has at any time taught the World, have always had a Tincture of Cruelty, and unreaſonable Severity, and have betray'd therein the Malice of that wicked Spirit; yet this is not the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of true Religion, which is gentle, and kind, and uſeful in all its Injunctions. And accordingly the kind Angels who are endow'd abundantly with that diſpoſition, cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be delighted, or to take it as done at
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94187:87"/> all to their Honour, that Men ſhould hurt or torment themſelves.</p>
               <p>Further, 'tis ſaid and propos'd as a Pattern to others for their Imitation, That this Perſon faſted in Honour of the Angels at leaſt twice in a Yeat (we muſt underſtand this does not mean that he faſted but twice in a Year; but it is intended to ſignifie, that he kept at leaſt two Faſts in a year in Honour of the Angels, and which he deſign'd to honour them by) To wit, on the laſt day of <hi>February,</hi> and on the laſt day of <hi>September;</hi> becauſe the holy Church in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places celebrates the Feſtival of the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-Angels on the firſt day of <hi>March,</hi> and on the firſt of <hi>October.</hi> And this he did, we muſt know, to diſpoſe himſelf by theſe Abſtinences, to receive thoſe Showers of Graces which they pour down particularly on this day. This ſure is to make the Angels Diſpenſers of theſe good Things, and to teach the People to expect and deſire them from them. About the time of theſe two Feaſts he went to viſit the Priſons and Hoſpitals, to comfort and aſſiſt the Sick and Impriſon'd there with his Alms. And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is done in Honour, and to the Glory of the Angels. And thus they uſually put the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Charity, and the giving of Alms, which are ſome of the greateſt Pleaſures that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be, to a good and well-diſpos'd Mind, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Works of Mortification and Sufferance. 'Tis a fine Story they tell of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> who came to be Pope, to encourage this giving of Alms in Honour of the Angels. He, ſay they, having given a Dinner to 12 poor People, he ſaw one of them who became very beautiful, and glorious as an Angel, and ſaid to him, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94187:87"/> you thought with your ſelf that you gave your Alms to a poor Man, but you have given them to an Angel; and God has ſent me to be conſtantly from henceforth near you, and to guard you to the laſt Period of your Life. For a Recompence further of your Liberality, you ſhall be Head and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Paſtour of the Church, and all that which you ask of God, you ſhall obtain by my means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus is there a Pattern framed to teach People by, in what things they muſt honour their Guardian-Angel by Sufferance. They go yet further, and in the ſame method teach and direct how they are to be honour'd by their Prayers to them. It is ſaid therefore of this unknown Perſon, as follows:</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was riſen, and while he was upon his Knees, having done what hasbeen ſaid before, he implor'd the Succour of his Angel in theſe following words, which all Believers (ſay they) ought to know, and to recite every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Angele Dei, qui Cuſtos es mei,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Me tibi commiſſum pietate ſuperna,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Hodie, illumina, cuſtodi, rege, guberna.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <p>Here they call the Angel their Keeper, tho' indeed 'tis acknowledg'd he is ſo by the Divine Commiſſion: But they alſo pray to him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to illuminate, keep, govern and guide them.</p>
               <p>Again, before he began any Buſineſs, he made the ſame Prayer to his Guardian Angel. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as often as he heard the Clock ſtrike, he recommended his Soul to him againſt the point of Death, ſaying,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Angele Dei, qui Cuſtos es mei,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Adjura me nunc, &amp; in hora mortis.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:94187:88"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Angel! Who art commiſſion'd to keep me, aſſiſt me now, and in the hour of my Death.</hi> At the end of his Mental (by which they mean <hi>ex tempore)</hi> Prayer which he made in the Morning, He beſought the good Angel to beg for him of God, a firmneſs in his Reſolutions; and to thank him for all the Light and Knowledge which he had communicated to him; and to obtain what he ſhould ask for his Friends and fellow Aſſociates. Before he began his Study, he begg'd the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of his Coeleſtial Pedagogue; and he offer'd to him his Labours for the Glory of his Maſter, and for the Salvation of his Soul.</p>
               <p>He never fail'd to aſſiſt (or be preſent) eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day at the Holy Sacrifice of the Maſs: And it was at this time that he firſt recited the Office of the Guardian Angels, and after that their Chaplet or Roſary, which he did in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Upon the Croſs which hung at his ſtring of Beads, he ſaid the <hi>Te Deum Laudamus.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great Beads he ſaid the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> to thank God for the Favour he had done him, in giving him an Angel: And upon the little Beads he recited the Prayer aforeſaid. <hi>Angele Dei,</hi> &amp;c. (This then was ſaid in the Place of the <hi>Ave Mary's;</hi> and truly I believe it might be done with as much Profit, with leave of the good Fathers, the <hi>Dominicans.)</hi> At the time of the elevation of the Sacred <hi>Hoſtie,</hi> he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Soul, and that of all his fellow Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, into the Hands of Jeſus for the Hour of his and their Death. He communicated every Month, and at leaſt once to the Honour of his Dear Guide; and after this Communion he renew'd the Proteſtations of Fidelity to his Guardian Angel, which St. <hi>Charles Borromaeus</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:94187:88"/> did from time to time make to his: He alſo every Month viſited the Chappel dedicated to the Angel. 'Tis added this may be done on the firſt Tueſday of every Month; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are bid to remember that Tueſday is the day particularly deſtin'd for the Honouring of the Bleſſed Spirits by the Church; and that there is a Maſs for that day in particular which the Prieſts may celebrate, and which any one may cauſe to be ſaid in a caſe of Neceſſity (for a good Pay.)</p>
               <p>Every Year in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> he ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the Feaſt of the Holy Guardian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, with an extraordinary Devotion. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Sacraments with the greateſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; he redoubled his Alms, his Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, his Faſts, his Prayers. He renew'd thro' the whole <hi>Octave,</hi> the Proteſtations of St. <hi>Char. Borromaeus,</hi> in the Chappel of the Angel, which he viſited every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Every day before he lay down to reſt, he implor'd the Aſſiſtance of his Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, by the Litanies of the Angels which he recited upon his Knees. This is that, 'tis ſaid, which the Aſſociates ought to do every Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or during the time of Maſs. And 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any Man to have an ill Death, when he has ſo much wiſh'd, and ſo much begg'd the Grace to die well, by theſe Devotions.</p>
               <p>See here, ye Dear Aſſociates (ſay they) what Practices are to be perform'd in Honour of the Angels: And from what has been ſaid, theſe ſix important Verities (as they are call'd) are recommended to be the ſubject of ſerious Meditation. (1.) God is willing to ſave us by the Miniſtry of our Angel-Guardian. (2.) In
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94187:89"/> the ordinary Courſe of his Providence, he will no otherwiſe ſave us. (3.) This Guide will infallibly procure our Salvation, if we earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demand it. (4.) This great Affair of our Salvation depends upon our Death. (But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it is rather true to ſay it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the manner of ſpending our Life.) (5.) There is no one but our Angel who will as of Duty, be concern'd to aſſiſt us at our Death, and to protect us in this grievous Combat. (6.) The more Prayers there are for, and the more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that demand the ſame Grace, the more eaſily ſhall they obtain it. This is an effect of the Communion of Saints. Therefore the more Aſſociates there are in this Brotherhood, the more certainly may they hope to obtain the Grace to die well. Theſe now are wonderful Inducements to wheedle Men into this Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Guardian Angels, in order to ſecure a happy Death; and this laſt is a pretty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to perſwade thoſe who are in it to be decoys to others to bring them into the ſame Net.</p>
               <p>Now we ſhall take a more particular account of this Society, What is intended in it, and what they are directed and bind themſelves to do, who enter themſelves into it.</p>
               <p>This Aſſociation, they ſay, is nothing elſe but a Holy and Secret Union made between Believers, who being perſwaded of the great Importance of dying well, and of the Succours which we ought to expect from the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in that Moment, do unite their Prayers and their Vows which they addreſs to theſe amiable Protectors for this end. So that this Aſſociation is plainly a Combination of People,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94187:89"/> who bind themſelves to the voluntary Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Worſhipping of Angels, which the Holy Scripture forbids. Yet this is ſaid to be an Aſſociation which Heaven has inſpir'd Men with the deſign of, and does Authorize with a multitude of Favours; which the Believers who are engag'd in it, regard as a mark of their Predeſtination to Eternal Glory, and which the Prelates of the Church, the Arch-Biſhops, and the Biſhops, who endeavour to conduct their Flocks to Heaven, do effectually recommend; opening to the Aſſociates, the Treaſures of Indulgencies, of which they are the Diſpenſers.</p>
               <p>The Rules of Aſſociation are theſe;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe who enter this Society, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and receive the Communion at leaſt once a Year, either on the day of their Feſtival that is the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> or the firſt of <hi>October,</hi> or upon ſome other day that may prove more convenient. The deſign and end of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ought to be the ſame with that of the Aſſociation, that is, to obtain for themſelves, and all the reſt of the Aſſociates, the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Angels at the Point of Death, and particularly the Grace to die well. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate then to the Honour of the Angels, ſay they: Here is one of the higheſt Acts of Divine Worſhip order'd to be perform'd to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Creatures: Receiving the Communion as they ſometimes ſpeak of it, is ſaid to be an Offering to God the Victim of his Immaculate Son; and this they do to the Honour of the Angels. What can deſerve the Name of the moſt impious and deteſtable Idolatry, if this does not? Is this no more than to pray the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to pray for us?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:94187:90"/>2. They muſt promiſe, to viſit the Chappel which is dedicated to the Guardian Angel at leaſt once a year; and if this can conveniently be, it ſhould be done on the day of the Feaſt of the Guardian A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gels to gain the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They of the Society muſt promiſe to their good Angel, to recite every day the Office or Litany of the Angels, or the Teſtament of St. <hi>Charles Borromeus:</hi> (which I ſhall produce anon) Or if they cannot read, they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to recite three times the <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> and three times the <hi>Ave Mary,</hi> to the Honour of the three Coeleſtial Hierarchies, that they may obtain for all the Aſſociates, in whatever part of the World they be, the Grace to die well.</p>
               <p>The Form of the Aſſociation, which is an Engagement to the Service of the Angels, as they ſpeak, is as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My moſt dear and kind Angel, Guardian of my Body and my Soul, whom God has commiſſion'd to watch over and keep me at all times, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at the hour of my Death; Diſpleaſed with my ſelf for my paſt Ingratitudes, I come now to make to you an inviolable Proteſtation of my Service. I promiſe you at the foot of the Holy Altar, that, as after</hi> Jeſus <hi>and</hi> Mary <hi>you are the foundation of the hope which I have to die well, ſo for the future you ſhall be the object of my Vows, of my Reſpects, and of my Loves. I ask of you one Favour, and 'tis that which I know you do paſſionately deſire to confer upon me. Aſſiſt me at the Hour of my Death, and beſides me, all thoſe who ſhall aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with this Deſign. It is to obtain this of you, that I purpoſe to communicate at leaſt once a year, to your Honour; to viſit your Chappel, and to</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:94187:90"/> 
                  <hi>make ſome Prayers to you every day. O hear me, ſince you have ſo much good will to me! Fortifie me in this Combat, ſince my Salvation does thereon depend! Conduct me to Heaven, ſince 'tis for this that you are my Guide! Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Proteſtation or Teſtament of St. <hi>Charles Borromeus,</hi> mentioned before, I ſhall now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, juſt as it is, though ſo long, becauſe I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to repreſent all theſe matters as I have them from the Romaniſts themſelves. It runs thus:</p>

                  <q>In the Name of the moſt Holy Trinity, I <hi>N.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I proteſt again, O my Dear Angel! That under your Guard and Protection, I would depart this Life with a mighty confidence in your Succours, and with a plain and entire hope in the Mercy of my God. Combat in that moment the Enemies of my Salvation: Receive my Soul at its going out of the Body: Render Jeſus favourable to me after Death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I proteſt likewiſe, my Bleſſed Angel, That I demand moreover, from the bottom of my Heart, to partake of the Merits of the Blood of my Saviour: I deteſt all the Sins I have committed by Works, Thoughts, or Words. I pardon all mine Enemies. I would die with the Croſs faſtned to my Heart, to ſignifie
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94187:91"/> that I found my Hopes upon the Merits of him who has ſtain'd it with his Blood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I proteſt alſo, O moſt faithful Friend, who will not abandon me in this my laſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; that through the deſire which I have to go to Heaven, I am ready to ſuffer all that which the Juſtice of my God ſhall think fit to inflict.

               <p>See here ſome Lines of the Character of a Modern Roman Saint: One might ſearch the Scripture long enough before one could find ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of theſe: But while <hi>Rome</hi> makes ſuch Saints, I doubt they are canonized too ſoon.

               <p>The Great Church of the City was formerly <note place="margin">St. <hi>Gudule.</hi>
                  </note> dedicated to St. <hi>Michael,</hi> but it ſeems the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of it is alter'd, and the Angel has been forc'd for ſome years, to give the Honour, and the Place, to the Saint, for it is now called the Church of St. <hi>Gudule.</hi> When Count <hi>Lambert,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Tournay,</hi> ſays Story, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated the Body of St. <hi>Gudule</hi> from another Church in this City, to this of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> they enlarged this Church conſiderably, at a great Charge, and endowed it with a good Revenue, and conſecrated it anew, dedicating it to this Saint; who was, as they ſay, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs deſcended of the Family of <hi>Charlemaigne.</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:94187:92"/> In this Church is a Chappel to the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which at the time we went in, had the greateſt number of People. The Altar was very richly adorn'd: There was ſtanding over it a tall Portal which ſeem'd to be Silver, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the Sacrament is wont to be ſet when 'tis produc'd only to be ſeen and ador'd, but it was not then there.

Six large Silver Lamps hung up before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and two very ſtately Chryſtal Candleſticks with many Silver Sockets round them for Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles: theſe laſt were a late Preſent made by the Electour of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to this Chappel.</p>
               <p>Here is kept in this Church in a little Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cheſt, and is ſhown only upon a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Holiday, once a Year, the <hi>Miraculous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Miraculous Sacrament.</note> as they call it; which is ſuch a Wafer as the Papiſts uſe in celebrating the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, to which the following Story belongs. In the Year 1369. as ſome of the Hiſtorians of this Countrey put it, one <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> with an ill Deſign, bought of a Certain Curate of St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s Church a Box with three conſecrated Wafers in it: He being afterwards kill'd by ſome Perſons, his Enemies, his Wife gave the Box to their Son named <hi>Abraham,</hi> with the <hi>Hoſties</hi> in it. He, upon a <hi>Good-friday,</hi> took an <hi>Hoſtie</hi> out of the Box, and in contempt of our Saviour, went about to ſtab and cut it with his Knife, when at every Wound he made in it there iſſued Blood. The Woman, his Mother, admiring the Miracle, immediately became a Chriſtian. And having diſcover'd the matter to the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires Peter</hi> and <hi>John Valvius,</hi> the former Curate
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94187:92"/> of St. <hi>Gudule,</hi> the latter of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> the Wickedneſs of the <hi>Jew</hi> was publiſh'd; ſo that <hi>Wenceſleus</hi> then Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Johanna</hi> his Wife, having diligently examin'd the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cauſed <hi>Abraham</hi> and other <hi>Jews</hi> that had joyn'd with him in the Impiety, to be burnt alive before the Church of St. <hi>Catharine.</hi> The Examinations about this matter, and the whole Proceſs are ſaid to be kept in the Chamber of Accounts of <hi>Brabant.</hi> The Duke and Dutcheſs in a ſolemn Proceſſion attended this wounded <hi>Hoſtie</hi> to the Church of St. <hi>Gudule,</hi> and repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited it there; and a Holiday was appointed to commemorate the Miracle, and a ſolemn Proceſſion, in which it ſhould be carried about and be ſhown to the People.

It is ſaid the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mechlin</hi> perform'd the Service, attended by four Abbots, that he carried the miraculous <hi>Hoſtie</hi> in the Proceſſion, and that there were 8000 Wax Torches and Flambeaus carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. I doubt not but ſome mighty Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was the Lure that brought ſo many People together, and perhaps it was a new one granted in conſideration of the late Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the City, for theſe Occaſions bring Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney both to Prieſts and People.

               <p>If this Story were true, it might be reckon'd a miraculous Confirmation of the Truth of Chriſtian Religion; but it does not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for the Abſurdity of Tranſubſtantiation, tho' 'tis very likely it was at firſt but a Juggle contriv'd for a pretended Proof of that, as it is to this day reputed a mighty one; I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to be the beſt they have.</p>
               <p>In this Church, as I remember, I ſaw an Altar with an Image of the Virgin over it, which has an Inſcription belonging to it, that calls her <hi>Maria pacis.</hi> On the Front of the great Houſe before-mention'd, call'd the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> there is ſomewhat relating to this matter. One ſees there two Inſcriptions in great Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which run croſs the whole Front; the one of which is, <hi>A Peſte, Fame &amp; Bello, libera nos</hi> Maria <hi>Pacis;</hi> The other is, <hi>Hic Votum fecit</hi> Elizabetha <hi>pro Pace publica.</hi> I ſuppoſe this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> to have been <hi>Iſabella-Clara-Eugenia,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who married her in the Year 1598. to <hi>Albert</hi> the Sixth Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whom he made Governour of theſe Countries. This Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpeaks fully out what they mean by their Application to the Saints, and downright asks
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94187:93"/> of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe would deliver them from the Plague, Famine, and War. It ſpeaks, too, their Opinion of Images while the Prayer is made, as their Phraſe is, to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> and the People in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Talk will ſay, <hi>One Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>has done a great many Miracles, but another has done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are a great many Convents of Friars and Nuns in this City, for theſe people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly chuſe the moſt populous and pleaſant places to retire from the World, and mortifie themſelves in; many of them were beaten down by the Bombs out of the <hi>French</hi> King's ardent Zeal to promote the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. The <hi>Dominicans</hi> had a large Church here, the <note place="margin">Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</note> Walls and Cover of which are up, and they were ſaying Maſs at two or three ſorry Altars in it, to be doing; for ſomething doing, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing coming. A large Diviſion of this Church, which is almoſt half of it, was before, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd again for the Chappel of the Roſary. The Roſary is a Set of Prayers to the Virgin, which, if you will believe them, ſhe her ſelf or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and aſſiſted St. <hi>Dominick</hi> to recommend to the World, a thing that has done mighty matters, but chiefly has well provided for this Order, and fatned them up as Hogs for the Slaughter. For as the Inſtitution of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">The Roſary.</note> From of Devotion is deriv'd from this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo they have all the Profits of it. The Chappels of the Roſary belong to them, and the Brotherhood of the Roſary are their People, and are joyn'd to them, and all the mighty Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Indulgences granted to the Roſary, are diſpenſed by theſe Monks; and by Virtue
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94187:94"/> of theſe matters there is no ſort of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended religious Orders, who look more jolly, and fat, and ſhine with their own Greaſe more than theſe Butcherly Fellows. This method of Devotion has drawn in ſuch multitudes of People of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, and makes ſo great and conſiderable a part of the Worſhip and Devotion of that Church, that one ſhould give a very imperfect Account of the State of Religion in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a diſtinct Account of the Devotion of the Roſary. I ſhall therefore produce ſome of the moſt obſervable Particulars which I have met with relating to this matter, wherein we ſhall ſee a great deal of dull and tedious trifling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name and Pretence of Devotion; a deal of impious Idolatry in the Worſhip of the Virgin, if ever there was, or can be ſuch a thing as Idolatry in the Worſhip of a Creature, and we ſhall ſee the main buſineſs of Worſhip turn'd into Applications to the bleſſed Virgin, and in a word, the Chriſtian Religion turn'd <hi>Marian.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Roſary,</hi> or Garland of Roſes, is a Set of Prayers to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> intermixed with the Lord's Prayer. Theſe, both one and other, are number'd by the Beads which one ſhall ſo often ſee in the Hands of the People in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Countries, eſpecially when they go to Church. The String of Beads is tied together at the ends, and has commonly fifty ſmall, and five greater Beads in the round; and there are beſides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> I think, of the ſmall Beads with one great one upon a little ſtrait String, with a Croſs, which hangs to the other. On the ſmal Beads
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94187:94"/> they ſay ſo many <hi>Ave Mary's,</hi> as theſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Virgin are commonly call'd, becauſe they begin with the Words of the Angel's Salutation of her, when he came to tell her ſhe ſhould be honour'd with bearing the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> To which Salutation they have added, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and a Concluſion in the Form of a Supplication to the B. Virgin: The whole Prayer runs thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hail</hi> Mary, <hi>full of Grace, the Lord is with thee, bleſſed art thou above all Women; and bleſſed is the Fruit of thy Womb, Jeſus: Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of God, pray for us poor Sinners now, and in the Hour of our Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Prayer is repeated ten times, and then comes the Lord's Prayer, which is repeated as often as the great Beads come. The whole <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> or Garland of Prayers conſiſts of this String of Beads three times repeated, which comes to fifteen times ten <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> and fifteen <hi>Pater Noſters.</hi>

                     <head>When, and upon what occaſion the <hi>Roſary</hi> was inſtituted.</head>
                     <p>This method of Devotion ſo erroneouſly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Virgin, whom they pray to ten times in it for one Prayer to Almighty God, has no other Foundation but a Story as impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as ſilly, and evidently deviſed to derive it from the Bleſſed Virgin her ſelf. Indeed this does but help to fill up the Parallel between <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen and Popiſh; and if <hi>Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius</hi> might pretend to derive his Rules of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from a Goddeſs; why might not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Dominick</hi> derive his from ſuch an one too?
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94187:95"/> Thus then, as they ſay, this great and divine Inſtitution as brought into the World. When the holy <hi>Dominick</hi> had been in continual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the Country of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> with (thoſe wicked People) the <hi>Albigenſian</hi> Hereticks (who always abhorr'd and refus'd to receive the Corruptions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) as well by preaching, diſputing, and writing of Books, as by wonderful Signs and Miracles; and now three years and more time was paſt in great Trouble and Labour, but with little Profit: The H. Man not being able any longer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the great Obſtinacy of theſe Hereticks, together with their impious and deteſtable Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy (as 'tis call'd) againſt the moſt immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> at length he left them, and retir'd to a Cave in a Wilderneſs not far from thence, and there with many Sighs and Tears he applied himſelf for Aid to the Queen of Heaven, moſt earneſtly imploring her Aſſiſtance, it being her peculiar Work to tread under foot the Head of the curſed Serpent, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and bring to nought all new Sects and Hereſies. (Pretty well! here we have aſcrib'd to the Virgin in Words, what one ſhall often ſee in Pictures, that is, the Victory over the Devil, foretold from the beginning of the World, and applied by all the primitive Church to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as being meant of him our great and only Redeemer.)</p>
                     <p>Continuing thus in Prayer, and chaſtening his Body for three days together with Faſtings, at laſt the holy mother of God reveal'd her ſelf to him now lying very weak and fainting under the Blows of Iron Chains, and to him ſhe ſaid; <hi>My Son</hi> Dominick, <hi>becauſe you have very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94187:95"/> ſtrove againſt the Enemies of me and of the Truth, I, whom you have call'd to, am ready to give you my Aſſiſtance.</hi> She had not ſooner ſaid this, but behold three Maids appear'd of moſt wonderful Beauty, who, having rais'd up <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick</hi> from lying flat upon the Earth, they ſet him before <hi>Mary;</hi> ſhe then moſt lovingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd, and kiſs'd him, and making bare her Virgin Breaſts, ſhe gave him ſuck (poor Fool) thus comforting his ſinking, thirſty Heart with this moſt delicious Draught. Then ſhe ſpoke to him again, ſaying, <hi>My faithful Friend</hi> Dominick, <hi>know you not what Inſtruments God hath been wont to make uſe of when he would reform and renew the World?</hi> Upon which he made anſwer; <hi>Oh, gracious Mother! you know that better than I do, for the World through you hath obtain'd its Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through you is the beginning of all our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Renovation. Mary</hi> then ſmiling upon him (a fooliſh <hi>Coquette</hi> indeed would be likely to do ſo, when ſhe had been prodigiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flatter'd, and a fond Admirer had aſcrib'd to her what were infinitely above her Merits) ſhe ſaid, <hi>God, that he might take away all Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, hath choſen no other Inſtrument but only the Angelick Pſalter, the which is the Foundation of the whole New Teſtament. If therefore you deſign ever to do any good with your Preaching, do you recommend and preach up my Pſalter, and in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time this evil ſhall come to an end.</hi> After this <hi>Mary</hi> proceeded largely to explain and ſhow the manner how to read the Pſalter or her <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;</hi> relating alſo to him the Excellency of the ſame, and the Profitableneſs of it, with the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and wonderous Power of it. In fine, ſhe gave <hi>Dominick</hi> a Charge that he ſhould ſtrait-way
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94187:96"/> repair to <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and there preſs and urge the ſame, admoniſhing him to be of good Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. But the Holy Man foreſeeing great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty (for by reaſon of the Rage of Hereſie, he ſaw no means to fulfill this Charge) he fell again at the feet of <hi>Mary,</hi> and anſwer'd thus. <hi>Oh moſt Dear Mother! You know how obſtinate and ſtiff-necked this People are? How can it be that they ſhould ſuffer me to preach before them? You know how many and ſubtle deſigns they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive againſt me? How is it poſſible that I ſhould diſcharge my ſelf of this task, and preach to them your</hi> Roſary? Upon which <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid, <hi>Do not trouble your ſelf for this; but go boldly into the City of</hi> Tholouſe, <hi>and commit the reſt to me; I will certainly cauſe that great numbers of People ſhall come to hear your Sermons, and whether they be pleas'd, or diſpleas'd, they ſhall be forc'd to hear you.</hi> Which when ſhe had ſaid, <hi>Mary</hi> vaniſh'd.</p>
                     <p>The Holy Father <hi>Dominick</hi> went ſtrait way to <hi>Tholouſe;</hi> when he came thither, all the Bells of the City began to ring of themſelves; the People hereupon in Multitudes, ran to the Church, and found there <hi>Dominick</hi> (who was ready for them) mounted into the Pulpit. With wondrous Earneſtneſs and Zeal, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to hold forth to them the Praiſes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the <hi>H. Roſary.</hi> The Hereticks im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſet themſelves to oppoſe him, ſome began to go out of the Church, others to cry out and make a Tumult. When behold on a ſudden, there aroſe ſo terrible a Storm, with Wind and Thunder and Lightning, and the Sky grew ſo diſmal dark, and to all this there was added ſuch a mighty Earthquake, that one would have thought the whole World were
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94187:96"/> falling to Ruine. Upon this no Perſon durſt venture himſelf out of the Church. (for they might be ſure that if the World ſhould fall to Ruines, the Church would not come upon their Heads) <hi>Dominick</hi> however went on vigorouſly with his Sermon, when behold there were heard in the Air, the hideous howlings of Infernal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſhrieking and crying out, <hi>Wo, Wo be to us, for we through the power of the</hi> H. Roſary, <hi>are by the Angels bound in red hot Chains, and thrown down to the depth of Hell.</hi> Neither was this all, for there was ſeen by all Perſons (notwithſtanding the darkneſs) a wooden Image of <hi>Mary</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on high, which reach'd out the Arm, and threatned them with the Finger, as if ſhe would have ſaid, <hi>If it be ſo that ye will not hear this my Servant, nor will be brought to Reverence my</hi> Roſary <hi>which he holds forth, you are all of you undone, ye ſhall utterly periſh.</hi> Through theſe terrible Menaces, and evident Miracles, the hardned Hearts of the People of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Repentance, they entreated the H. Man that he would intercede with the Holy Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for them. And ſtrait-way throwing themſelves all together upon the Ground, and wringing their Hands, they beſought the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God and <hi>Mary</hi> with Sighs and Tears that cannot be expreſs'd. <hi>Mary</hi> then gave ear to their Prayer, and did immediately for a Token of her Mercy, draw to her ſelf again her threatning Arm, ſo as that every one there preſent could ſee it done. And at the ſelf ſame time did all the ſtormy and tempeſtuous Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceaſe, and turn into a Calm.

                     <p>The People are exhorted to take care that they do this not only with the Mouth, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with the Heart, and with ſerious attention; to which purpoſe they are directed to begin their Tasks of Devotion with this Preface to the Virgin:</p>

                     <p>A pretty good beginning, and we ſhall find the reſt agreeable. They tell the People that 'tis good and profitable to read the <hi>Roſary</hi> with Meditations on the 15 Myſteries, by which they mean the principal parts of the Hiſtory of our Saviour; to which they have added ſome Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the Virgin, to make up the Number. When they do thus, then to every ten <hi>Ave Mary's,</hi> and a <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> there comes a <hi>Meditation,</hi> and this is attended with an Addreſs, either to the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> alone, or to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>B. Virgin;</hi> ane ſhe is for the moſt part the Principal Perſon applied to; ſome of theſe for a Specimen, I ſhall here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Reſurrection of Chriſt, the Prayer begins to Jeſus, and then is ſoon turn'd to the Virgin, in theſe words.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> N. N. <hi>Acknowledge and Confeſs, that I do with all my Heart put my ſelf under the defence of the moſt H.

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. When my appointed hour is come, I will immediately, if it be poſſible, either in the Church or elſewhere, as I can beſt do it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on my bended Knees, or as Opportunity and Convenience will allow, begin to read the <hi>Roſary</hi> of 15 Tens, and at the ſame time Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the 15 Myſteries of the Life and Death of our good Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ſhall offer the firſt part of the <hi>Roſary</hi> (that is the firſt 50 <hi>Aves)</hi> to God for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtian Princes, the Extirpation of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and the Converſion of Sinners. The 2d.

Then I will add to this, the Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our good Lady, on the behalf of all thoſe who have given themſelves up to this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome few further Reſolutions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, concerning the care that the Perſon will take to have theſe matters perform'd for him, when he is lawfully hindred, which I need not inſert.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dominick</hi> at firſt order'd that all the Brothers and Siſters ſhould read a whole <hi>Pſalter</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that is 15 times 10 <hi>Ave Mary's,</hi> with the due <hi>Pater Noſters</hi> every day.

And now this Task muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed once a Week, to the Glory of God, and of the Holy Maid, they ſay. And it needs not now be read all at once, or kneeling in the Church at any particular time, but 'tis enough that it be finiſh'd by the end of the Week.</p>
                     <p>If any Brother be deſirous to be a Partaker in the devout <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Salve Regina,</hi> which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day immediately after <hi>Compline</hi> is ſung in the Churches of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> with a ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, he muſt be preſent at the <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> or elſe read 7 <hi>Ave Mary's</hi> in what Place ſoever he is, for himſelf, and for the other Brothers.</p>

                     <p>Foraſmuch as the Holy Widow <hi>Anna</hi> has brought forth this honourable Fruit the holy Maid <hi>Mary,</hi> therefore that we may be in ſome meaſure thankful, the Founder of this Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood has wiſh'd and deſir'd that the Brothers and Siſters would, to the Honour of theſe three, namely, the holy Mother <hi>Anna,</hi> her Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> and Chriſt the Son of God and of Man, read on every <hi>Tueſday</hi> three <hi>Pater Noſters</hi> and three <hi>Ave's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Souls of the Brothers departed, after the four principal Feaſts of our good Lady, which are the Purification, the Annunciation, the Aſſumption and Birth, four yearly Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſhall be held at the Altar of the <hi>Roſary,</hi> at which Solemnities all the Brothers and Siſters ought to be preſent, and to which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by great Indulgences (where they muſt however drop their Offerings as well as their Beads, or elſe there is no Indulgence for them.)</p>
                     <p>Moreover, 'tis ſaid there are eſpecially three Feaſt-days which all of this Society ought to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize, which are the Feaſt of our good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Annunciation on the 25th of <hi>March,</hi> the Feaſt of the <hi>Roſary</hi> on the firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>Oct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> the Feaſt of the H. <hi>Dominick</hi> on the 4th. of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and this muſt be done in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels belonging to this Order.

                        <hi>An Admonition to All Men to enter themſelves in the Brotherhood of the H.</hi> Roſary.</head>
                     <p>I think fit to produce this, becauſe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will hereby underſtand from themſelves of what Extent and Eſteem this Brotherhood is in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and what are the Baits that catch Fools into this ſort of Snares. The Admonition was thus.</p>
                     <p>It were very fitting, that among good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, not to ſay among the Lovers of <hi>Mary,</hi> there ſhould not any one perſon be found, who is not enter'd into the renown'd Society of the holy Roſary, or who will not ſuffer himſelf to be perſwaded to do this as ſoon as may be; as well for the Abundant Indulgences therein to be enjoy'd, as alſo for the following Reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe the H. <hi>Roſary</hi> was at firſt found out by <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf, and through her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand inſtituted and order'd by St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and was at the firſt Inſtitution and Beginning of it attended with ſuch miraculous and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Signs at <hi>Tholouſe.</hi>

Certainly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94187:102"/> you would be happily provided for, if it were ſo that there were but only one H. perſon that would at all times pray for you. But now in this far renown'd Brotherhood there are a great many holy and perfect perſons in whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and prayers you might be a Partaker.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You can no way take a more effectual care that your Soul may be helped in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with many Prayers and Indulgences, than by entring your ſelf into this Brotherhood; for I dare ſay, and can aſſure you, that there is no King, nor Emperour, nor Pope, nor any Monarch whatever, that has ſo many Prayers ſaid for his Soul as one departed Brother or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the holy Roſary; which may be very eaſily made appear from all the Maſſes and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Solemnities which are perform'd and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for the Brothers of this Society.</p>
                     <p>For you muſt know, and it is a matter well worth Obſervation, that through the whole World in all Places, Cities, Corporations and Villages where this Society is erected, there is always every year at four Seaſons a Maſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd for the deceaſed Brothers and Siſters. (This has been mention'd before, with the times of it.) Now all theſe being added together, and reckon'd according to the multitude of places where this Brotherhood is maintain'd, as well in all the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> as in <hi>France, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Italy, Germany,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> &amp;c. would make out every year more than twelve hundred thouſand Maſſes: To which may be added all the Roſaries and Vigils that are read and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd every Week, and alſo all the good Works that are daily done in the whole Order of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> conſiſting of ſo many thouſand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94187:102"/> and in this Society alſo wherein are ſo many millions of Brothers and Siſters. All which good Works and Prayers come to the account of the Souls enter'd in the Society, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the making Satisfaction for them.

In the laſt place, it is greatly to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd that in this Society there is no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Burden; and that ſo great a Treaſure may be obtain'd, as it were, without labour, by reading only once a Week a whole <hi>Roſary,</hi> that is, one hundred and fifty <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> which may be divided into three Garlands, each containing five of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; and theſe may be ſaid in any time of the Week as men will, either going, ſtanding, ſitting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Thus is this recommended here as a fine eaſie way to Heaven, and yet the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it is forgotten when theſe Tasks of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion are enjoyn'd, as Penance and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                     <p>A world of Indulgences are granted to this Society to draw them to the Chappels of the Roſary, and drop their Offerings often in a Year. I ſhall not trouble my ſelf or my Reader with the mention of any of them; for I think it now high time to direct to ſomewhat elſe.</p>

There is a ſort of Coach in the middle, but ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious enough to hold ten People, and at leaſt four more may be diſpoſed in the Baskets at the two ends. We paid for our Carriage to <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain,</hi> each perſon 26 Stivers. It is reckon'd a Journey of 4 Leagues or Hours, but we made more of it, becauſe the way was much broken by reaſon of ſome Rain there had been. We ſet out at 8 a Clock in the Morning, ſtaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh our ſelves an hour by the way, and came to <hi>Lovain</hi> about two After-noon. Our Road was upon a high Country; for the moſt part Champion, with wide Fields plow'd, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Corn. The common Mould of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is a good fat Clay a little yellowiſh. We
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94187:104"/> ſaw ſeveral Villages at a diſtance but went through, I think, not one; we paſt however by many ſcattering Houſes that had been very ill uſed in the time of the War, and were become uninhabitable.</p>
               <p>On the way to <hi>Louvain</hi> we ſee on the Left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand at a diſtance from us, and ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us, the City of <hi>Mechlin,</hi> which is too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable <note place="margin">Mechlin.</note> a place not to be taken notice of in this Relation, ſince it can be ſaid we ſaw it, as we did for a good part of our way, tho' our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Progreſs directed us from going to it. This is one of the chief Cities of the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, and a very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient one. Tho' it is ſeated almoſt in the middle of <hi>Brabant,</hi> yet it is reckon'd, with a Compaſs about it, ſubject to its Juriſdiction, diſtinct from <hi>Brabant,</hi> and to be one of theſe 17 Provinces. It is ſaid to be a very neat City, it ſeem'd of a conſiderable bigneſs: It is ſtrongly fortify'd and ſurrounded with a very good Ditch. It ſtands upon the River <hi>Dyle</hi> foremention'd, and and Tide runs through the City, and riſes to a League above it. There are reckon'd here 17 Colledges of Tradeſmen, who have right to ſit in the Senate, and to vote in matters deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated. The Supreme Power is exerciſed by 12 Schepins, ſix of which are choſen from the Gentry, and ſix from the Colledges of Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The Trade of Tanning has been very great in this City; their Company was honour'd with Noble Priviledges: among others, with the Freedom of Hunting and Fowling. Here was formerly a great Woollen Manufacture, and then there were reckon'd at once 3200 Shops of Weavers in this City. The Founders Trade
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94187:104"/> was here conſiderable alſo, and formerly there was a great Magazine of all things neceſſary for War. At preſent the trifling Trade of making Lace employs many People here as well as in other Cities hereabout: But tho' we in <hi>England</hi> have given the name of <hi>Mechlin</hi>-Lace to the beſt, it is not here that better is made than in other places of this Country: The City is favour'd with a very good Air, and is very healthy: In it were educated <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> who was afterwards Emperour, under the Name of <hi>Charles</hi> V. Becauſe in thoſe times, as it had been for ſome time before, this City was the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Seat of the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Aunt of <hi>Charles</hi> V.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94187:105"/> them, and who therefore took the leſs care of them, and had the leſs Influence among them. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> had Authority in <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and the Juriſdiction belonging to it. The Biſhop of <hi>Utrecht</hi> had Authority in ſome other parts, and was the only Biſhop that had his Reſidence among them. The Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> had Authority in <hi>Roermonde</hi> and the Countrey about that; and he, with the Biſhop of <hi>Combray,</hi> divided the Province of <hi>Brabant.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> had ſome Authority in the Province of <hi>Zutphen.</hi> This State of the Church here, was thought an Advantage to the ſpreading of the Reformation among theſe People, and therefore to prevent this, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> reſolved to eſtabliſh ſeveral Biſhops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Accordingly in Conjunction with Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV. he erected three Archbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, which were, <hi>Cambray, Utrecht,</hi> and this <hi>Mechlin;</hi> under theſe he ſet ſeveral Biſhops: For <hi>Brabant</hi> there was one at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and one at <hi>Hertogen-boſch:</hi> For <hi>Guelderland</hi> there was a Biſhop ſet at <hi>Roermonde:</hi> For <hi>Flanders</hi> there were Biſhops at <hi>Ghent</hi> and <hi>Ipres;</hi> at which laſt place the firſt Biſhop was the famous <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Janſenius,</hi> the Reſtorer of the Doctrine of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' cruelly perſecuted in his Memory, ſince his Death, and in his Friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Cathedral Church at <hi>Mechlin</hi> is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>Rumbold,</hi> whom the Legend makes, to have been the Son of <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots;</hi> who by Prayers had obtain'd of Heaven this Son, but could not keep him when he had him: For when he was grown up, nothing would ſerve him but to be a Prieſt; he left his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deſpiſing his Crown and Kingdom, and was guided by an Angel into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he became Biſhop of <hi>Dublin.</hi> When his Father was dead, it was now known where he was, and the People attempted to take him by force, and make him their King; but he ſlipt through their Fingers, and was again guided by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to <hi>Rome:</hi> From thence he came into <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> preach'd the Goſpel here, and was the Apoſtle or Converter of theſe Countries. He by his Prayers, they ſay, obtain'd a Son for Count <hi>Ado;</hi> and when the Child was grown up, and drown'd, he brought him to Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. He was buſie in building a great Church when ſome wicked Fellows kill'd him, thinking he had by him a great Hoard of Money for the Work he was about. They took what he had, and threw his Body into the River: But the Body diſcover'd it ſelf there, and ſhin'd in the Dark like rotten Pork; found by the Glory that it caſt, it was taken up by Fiſhermen. This, tho' but a ſilly Story, and not well agreeing with it ſelf, is yet a very modeſt one, in compariſon to a multitude of others, which the Papiſts tell, of the Lives and Miracles of their Saints; who by the lying Wonders they have ſhamm'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World, have imitated and ſerv'd the Father of Lyes, more than the God of Truth; and by feign'd Stories of Saints, and Miracles
<pb n="978" facs="tcp:94187:106"/> evidently falſe, have diſcredited the true ones, which the Church has really been furniſh'd with; ſo have they diſparag'd and weakned, by this means, ſome of the great Confirmations of Chriſtianity, and promoted Atheiſm-and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>When we came near <hi>Louvain,</hi> we paſs'd by a large and magnificent Building, which is a <note place="margin">Auguſtine Nuns.</note> Houſe of the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Nuns; they were now, upon the Peace, return'd to it again, but liv'd in the City during the War, becauſe they were here expos'd to the Plunderings and Abuſes of the <hi>French.</hi> It belongs to theſe Nuns to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Lepers of <hi>Louvain</hi> and <hi>Heverlee,</hi> a place near it, and thoſe whom they find to be Lepers, they are bound to lodge in their Houſe, and to attend them till they are cur'd or die. In this Nunnery the Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> was bound to take an Oath to the City of <hi>Louvain,</hi> upon his coming to his Dignity, before he might enter the City; and beſides, he was to hear Maſs at the Altar of St. <hi>George</hi> here, and leave a good Offering, which, tho' the Saint, if there were ſuch an one, has no need of, yet the Nuns knew what to do with it.</p>

The Name of it, ſays he, is obſervable in Hiſtory before the Year 740.

               <p>Civil Broils were the ruine of this vaſt Trade, <note place="margin">Civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions.</note> and put an end to the Proſperity of this City, which now looks old and decay'd and too big for its Inhabitants. The occaſion of this Miſchief was this. The City had always been govern'd by the Families of the Nobility, who govern'd it in the Form of a Senate; but when Trade had made the Commons rich, they diſdain'd to be govern'd, and grew ſo proud, that they would needs have a Share in the Government. After many Inſurrections and Seditions to this purpoſe, they alter'd the ancient Government, and obtain'd that an equal Number of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſhould ſit in the Senate-Houſe with the Nobility, and with equal Authority. Then they had broken the Power of the Government, and it became too weak to hinder them from doing Miſchief to one another; they were divided into Parties and Factions, which often fell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Ears. Once in the Senate Houſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94187:108"/> they fell out, and threw one another headlong out at the Windows, who, falling, were receiv'd on the Pikes of others that ſtood below, and barbarouſly murder'd. When things were at this paſs, there was no Authority that any one ſtood in awe of, they had Liberty enough now to deſtroy one another, as Malice, or Envy, or Covetouſneſs, or Ambition ſet them on; there was no Order, no Safety, and a multitude of themſelves diſcourag'd by theſe ill Effects of their own Folly, left their Countrey with their Goods and Effects, and came for <hi>England.</hi> Thus this People diſdaining the Government under which they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The City had utterly ſunk by this means, and made it ſelf an heap of Rubbiſh, if the Prince had not ſetled here an Univerſity, which, together with ſome little Linen-Trade, is the preſent Suppott of it.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94187:108"/> Privileges granted to the Profeſſors and Students. The Schools for publick Exerciſes are in a large Stone Building, not far from St <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church. At the ground there is a Room which takes up the greateſt part, I think, of the bottom, wherein they hold publick Feaſts upon occaſion. Over it is a ſtone Arch, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with ſome very great Pillars. We went up ſtairs to ſee the Rooms call'd the Schools, they look the moſt of them, as unfiniſht; they are all large Rooms, and very high, for I think there is nothing over them. Thoſe which are handſomeſt, and ſeem'd finiſh'd, are the Schools for Divinity, and for Canon Law. They have ſeats againſt the Wall, and are wainſcoat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a good height. This Houſe, in the time when the City flouriſh'd in Trade, was built by the City as the Hall of the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory; it was finiſh'd in the year 1317. They had a beginning of a publick Library given them by <hi>Laurentius Beyerlinck,</hi> about the year 1627. to which ſome additions have ſince been made, but I doubt it is in no very good Condition, and therefore was not ſhown to us.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Martin</hi> in his Bull of Eſtabliſhment, gave <note place="margin">Faculty of Theology.</note> a general liberty for all other ſorts of Studies, but excepted that of Divinity. This alſo was granted 5 years after the Eſtabliſhment of the Univerſity, by Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the IV. Upon the earneſt Application of <hi>Philip,</hi> ſirnam'd the Good, Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> and of the Senate and People of <hi>Louvain;</hi> and alſo of <hi>Erard de Marca,</hi> Cardinal, who was then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Prince of <hi>Leige;</hi> for this City was then in Eccleſiaſtical Matters, ſubject to that Biſhop, as it is now to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mechlin.</hi> He gave liberty for ſtudying Divinity there, and that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94187:109"/> the degree of Maſter ſhould be conferr'd upon thoſe who had perform'd a due courſe of ſtudy, and ſhould be judg'd qualified for it by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Dean of the Faculty, or any that ſhould be deputed by them. And then being Maſters, they had liberty themſelves alſo to read and teach Divinity; this Bull was ſign'd and ſeal'd on the Nones of <hi>March,</hi> in the year 1431. the day which is the Feſtival of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas,</hi> call'd the Angelical Doctor, whom the School of Divinity here reſpect as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. This Liberty was no ſooner granted, but they fell earneſtly to work in the ſtudy of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and made St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> principally, with St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> their Rule in ſtating all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. After ſome Deliberations among thoſe who had obtain'd this Liberty about the ſetling a certain ſtipend for the Profeſſors of Divinity, it was determin'd by a Bull of Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> aforeſaid, in the year 1443. upon the deſire of Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Burgomaſters of the Town, and other Rectors of the Univerſity, That there ſhould be annexed and incorporated to Academical Profeſſions, 3 Prebends or Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates of the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> together with the <hi>Plebania,</hi> or Parochial Cure of the ſame; two of which Prebends, with the Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, were diſpoſed to the 3 ordinary Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Divinity; the 3d to the ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the Canon Law. Afterwards <hi>Charles</hi> the V. Emperor in the year 1546. augmented the School of Divinity with two daily and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Lectures; the one to be upon the Holy Scripture for Explication of that, the other to be Scholaſtical upon the Maſter of the Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and he endowed each with a Sallary of 200 Florins a year. The Lecture upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

To him ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Jacobus Janſonius, Jacobus Stapletonus, Joannes Paludanus, Cornelius Janſenius,</hi> who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Biſhop of <hi>Ypres:</hi> This is he from whom the followers of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> are nicknam'd <hi>Janſeniſts.</hi> He, that he might be ſure to repreſent exactly true the Doctrine of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> read his Works over, as he ſays, ten times; as he did this, he gather'd out of him all that related to his Controverſies with the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of his time, and all his Doctrine concerning the Grace of God, and his Gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous Election; he then digeſted his Collections into a Method, and wrote from them a large Book, which he call'd <hi>Auguſtinus:</hi> When he had finiſh'd it he died, but left it as his Will to his Executors, that it ſhould be printed, which was done accordingly. This Book has been, and is ſtill receiv'd by many, as containing, and repreſenting rightly the true Doctrine of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and theſe are loaded with the Odious Name of <hi>Janſeniſts:</hi> For the Jeſuits and their Party have got that Book condemn'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, having as they pretend, found in it 5 Propoſitions which are Hereti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that they might the more effectually find out and oppreſs all who favour the Opinions and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> they have obtain'd of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> a form of an Oath or Teſt, which they oblige all the Clergy to take, who are admitted to any Benefice wherein they
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94187:110"/> muſt condemn thoſe Propoſitions, as taken out of <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s Book, and in the ſence where in he underſtood and uſed them, as Heretical.</p>
               <p>The form of the Oath, as it was fram'd and eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII. Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> runs thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> N. N. <hi>ſubmit my ſelf to the Apoſtolick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the moſt High Biſhops,</hi> Innocent X. <hi>dated the 31ſt of</hi> May, 1653: <hi>and of</hi> Alexander VII. <hi>dated the 16th of</hi> October, 1656; <hi>and do with a ſincere mind renounce, and ſwear that I renounce, and condemn, the Five Propoſitions drawn out of the Book of</hi> Cornelius Janſenius, <hi>Intituled</hi> Auguſtinus; <hi>and in the ſence of them intended by the Author, as the Apoſtolick Chair has condemn'd them by the aforeſaid Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Conſtitution has occaſion'd a great deal of Controverſie which has run among the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of <hi>France,</hi> and of the Lower <hi>Germany</hi> chiefly: in which many bold Enquiries have been made into the Extent, at leaſt, of the Pope's Infallibility; and both that and his Supremacy have been very familiarly treated and ſhaken, and have certainly ſuffer'd more from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of ſome who have ſet themſelves extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly to advance them, than from the others who would bring them nearer to Truth and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: It would be too long a Digreſſion here to give a particular Account of the ſtate of this Controverſie, and therefore I ſhall lay it aſide for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſhall not wholly paſs over the People <note place="margin">Janſeniſts.</note> call'd <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> who are ſaid to be very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in all the Lower <hi>Germany;</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly go among the People, under the name of the <hi>good Party;</hi> and if ſome things be true of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94187:110"/> them, which the Adverſe faction in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> lay to their Charge, they deſerve that name. I ſhall take notice of ſome things laid to their charge by their Enemies, and tho' this may be reckon'd very improper in moſt caſes, yet I reckon theirs will bear it; becauſe their Enemies ſay many good things of them, and ſuch as if they are not true, one would wiſh they were; and indeed they diſparage themſelves and truly recommend theſe People while they lay ſuch things to their charge as faults, and as matter of Accuſation. I take care in all the accounts I give of things in this relation to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce nothing but what is Authentick; and therefore, I ſhall derive my Account of theſe People chiefly from the Complaints which the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mechlin</hi> has made of them in his Paſtoral Letter, dated <hi>October</hi> the 12th. 1692. He therein lays to their charge, that they opine and ſpeak with too little reſpect of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> that they deſpiſe the Church of their own Time, and cry up the Ancient, and Primitive ſtate of Chriſtianity: That they are for correcting and rectifying the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline of the preſent Times: That they ſet themſelves againſt the Religious Families (that is, the ſeveral Orders of Monks, thoſe uſeleſs drones that live in eaſe and plenty, upon ſpecious cheats) that they reproach and calumniate theſe good People, and ſeek to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them. They are blam'd by him for making it a ſolemn and ſerious matter to come to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; and for urge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that People muſt come with minds purified from worldly and carnal affections; and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon a true repentance and amendment of Liſe, as neceſſary to the obtaining Abſolution.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94187:111"/> And it is reckon'd a mighty fault that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely ſtrike at the Worſhip of the B. Virgin, that they beat down the Eſteem and Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Images, that they ridicule the Peregrinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Pilgrimages which are vow'd and made to them: They are blam'd for that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Pio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Aſſemblies and Fraternities which are erected in Honour of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> either in private Diſcourſes, or in books Printed without the Authors names. Yea ſome (he ſays) are grown to that degree of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they deſpiſe, as of no value, the merits of Chriſt and the Saints, as diſpenſed, and communicated by the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> who (he ſays) is the grand Treaſurer of theſe things (meaning hereby the cheat of Indulgences); and that they condemn as ſuperſtitious and vain, all that truſt and confidence which the Chriſtian People juſtly (as he ſays) place in them. And thoſe have been found he ſays (Oh horrid Crime) who have reflected upon the uſual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices or Maſſes of Catholicks for the relief of the Dead; as if the Prieſts that ſay them, have more comfort and benefit from them, than any Souls in Purgatory. The conſequence of theſe things he ſays is, that the Common People do many of them forſake the cuſtoms of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, grow fond of Novelties, and many others hang in doubt and ſuſpence what they ſhould do. (That is, whether they ſhould reform in matters that need to be reform'd, or go on ſtill in all their old Superſtitions and Idolatries.) Such diviſions too there are among all ſorts of People upon theſe matters, that he fears a Schiſm, he ſays, and that at length ſome will ſhake off the bridle of Obedience, and rend the ſeamleſs Coat of Chriſt in pieces. Thus he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94187:111"/> does as his Fore-fathers were wont to do, that is, call a neceſſary Separation from a corrupt and wicked Communion, Schiſm; and by him too ſhall Reformation be adjudg'd Hereſie; but there is a God that ſees and knows all things, who will judge the World in righteouſneſs at laſt, and give to every thing its right Name and Character, to whoſe righteous Judgment we appeal againſt the Haughty and unjuſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>ly betrays it ſelf to have been forg'd among the Jeſuits, whom, honeſt People, one never knows when to believe. It ſpeaks out fully the old ſpite of that Order againſt the Univerſity of <hi>Louvain,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Anthony Arnauld,</hi> the famous Doctor of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and their terrible Scourge. It imputes <hi>Janſeniſm</hi> to the generality of the Secular Prieſts, within the Dominion of the States General of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces;</hi> whom the Author repreſents to be in great numbers ſpread about and fixed in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Cures in thoſe Provinces. Theſe he makes to have been infected with this feign'd Hereſie, by vertue of their being bred in that wicked place, the Univerſity of <hi>Louvain;</hi> and partly by the influence which Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid had for a long time in theſe Countries, whom he will have to have liv'd at <hi>Delft,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his retirement, which was for ſeveral Years, to avoid the malice of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94187:112"/> till he died: And I may add that his Friends have as yet thought fit to conceal the place of his Burial, left the dead body ſhould feel the furious vengeance of the implacable Society of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>This Author imputes to theſe <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> that they hold and teach all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the Predeſtinarian Doctrine, in all the enormity and abſurdity of it; but this one cannot juſtly believe of them, as well, becauſe they conſtantly diſown and reject all that, as becauſe the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> of theſe Countries fall foul upon them on the other ſide, and have treated them very rudely, and ill, becauſe they will not explain the Points belonging to that Controverſie juſt as they do.</p>
               <p>That which I deſign eſpecially to take notice of is the Noveltieſm practice, which they are ſaid to introduce among the Papiſts in theſe Countries. There are, 'tis ſaid, many of theſe Prieſts who regard as null and invalid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions made to any of the Religious Orders, and upon that ground do require of the People when they come to them, that they begin and make to them the Confeſſion of their whole Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bile. They put in practice the maxim of Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> in his book of frequent Communion, which is, That thoſe who want a ſincere and pure love of God ought to be ſeparated from the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. (It is indeed a heinous crime with the Jeſuits to inſiſt upon the abſolute neceſſity of the love of God, either to fit men for this Communion, or for their Salvation.) Theſe Prieſts are ſaid to impoſe hard and rigorous Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for very ſmall Crimes. Many of them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94187:112"/> at <hi>Rotterdam, Delft,</hi> and the adjacent places, pronounce the Sacramental words of <hi>Baptiſm, Abſolution, Marriage</hi> and <hi>Extream Unction</hi> in the Vulgar language, when they adminiſter theſe Sacraments. Some pronounce thoſe words twice; That is, firſt in <hi>Latine</hi> and then in <hi>Dutch,</hi> and that without fear of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Sacriledge by this Repetition of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred words, which do not operate the ſecond time that which they ſignifie. They condemn and diſparage in their Sermons, and Books which they diſtribute among the Proteſtants, the rich and coſtly furniture of Altars, and the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of conſecrated Veſſels: They with <hi>Judas</hi> (to put them in good company) call this a waſt of expence, and a true Luxury. And for the moſt part they make ſo little account of Indulgences, eſpecially of thoſe which are to be applied to the Souls in Purgatory by way of ſuffrage; that there are many, and thoſe ſome of the Principal among them, who refuſed to publiſh, others who very negligently pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, that of the Year 1690. granted by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VIII. which is the more ſurprizing, ſays this perſon, becauſe the Catholicks of <hi>Holland</hi> have been wont to have a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion for theſe things; eſpecially for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence which is granted to the general month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion, for the living and the dead. Theſe Gentlemen, he ſays, do particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt this, and endeavour to aboliſh the uſe of it. They ſpeak of Purgatory in a very unworthy manner, and yet worſe of the Relicks of the Saints. They publiſh that we are not bound to believe that the Saints know the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which men make to them. They do not content themſelves only to leave out the Title
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94187:113"/> of <hi>Immaculate,</hi> which their Anceſtors were wont, time out of mind, to give to the Bleſſed Virgin in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Creed: nor to change the Phraſe in the Angelick Salutation, <hi>Bleſſed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Be it ſo. Theſe things I leave to the Wiſe to make their uſe of, and to conſider what uſe might perhaps be made of them, when his Majeſty ſhall be able to find a Perſon to reſide in thoſe Countries, who has a due Senſe and Veneration for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and a Zeal to encourage and promote Reformation, and who would make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way of Worſhip uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and admired abroad by all judicious perſons that know it, as publick and notorious in his Family as he could. God grant ſuch a time may come</p>
               <p>To <hi>Janſenius</hi> in this Lecture ſucceeded his Friend <hi>Libertus Fromondus,</hi> a follower of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and the Editer of his Book. By ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of later times the Faculty of Theology here is augmented to Nine Profeſſions: And the ordinary College or Society of this Faculty is made up of Eight Doctors, whom they call Legents and Regents: Becauſe to theſe alone
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94187:113"/> belongs the Authority of governing the School of Theology, and the Students of the Faculty; and of examining the Students in order to their taking of Degrees, and theſe alone enjoy the Emoluments of the School. And theſe, when any of their number dies, chuſe another into his place whom they judge the moſt fit for it. At length thoſe of the Religious Orders are allow'd admiſſion into this College; but with this reſtriction, that there ſhall never be two of the ſame Order in this Society at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>There are in this Univerſity of founded Schools and Colleges 32, beſides the Colleges <note place="margin">Colleges.</note> of the Religious Orders. Some of theſe are appropriated to the Arts, ſome to Languages, to Hiſtory, to Politicks, ſome to other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Faculties: And ſome are not confin'd to any one ſort of Study, but ſerve in general for all. There are ſome Colleges to which certain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Sums are left by the Founders, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for ſo many Students, which not being ordinarily enough to provide them their diet, they muſt ſupply the remainder out of their own Stock. In others there is a full and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proviſion ſo made for their Diet. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides Diet, they are allow'd by the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation Fire, and Candle, and ſome further aſſiſtance for their Studies. Theſe allowances they call here Purſes. They are for the moſt part annexed to ſuch and ſuch Colleges, and expreſly deſign'd for the encouragement of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Studies, which therefore, they who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them are bound to follow. Some Purſes are given, which leave the Poſſeſſors at liberty in what College they will to reſide, and ſo to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94187:114"/> what Study they pleaſe to apply themſelves. Every College has its Preſident, who has the direction of the Manners and Studies of the Students, and the Care of the Family: And beſides him, there are Viſitors either appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Founder, or deputed by the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or by the Heads of the particular Faculties. It is their buſineſs to admit to the Enjoyment of the Purſes belonging to the College to viſit, at ſtated times in the Year, and enquire into the Studies and Manners of thoſe who enjoy the Purſes; and to Audit the Accounts of the College once in a Year. I went into ſome of the Colleges, and found them built round a Court; in one corner of which from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to the top was the Preſidents Apartment; in another place the Chappel: And all the Rooms below were of ſome general uſe; as Dining Room, Kitchin and the like. Over the doors of ſome we ſhould ſee written, <hi>Schola Phyſices,</hi> or <hi>Schola Logices,</hi> &amp;c. In two Stories above were the Chambers for the Students.</p>

This good ſervice done to Truth and Juſtice, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Quiet of the Univerſity, was the firſt foundation of all the ſpite and malice, with which thoſe good Fathers have ſince perſecuted the Book and Memory of Biſhop <hi>Janſenius.</hi> To this day, I was told they have not been able to accompliſh the erecting of any School here, but they are only permitted to Catechiſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their Chappel; which they do every Lords day in the Afternoon, at the time of Veſpers.</p>

They are very angry with a Perſon that Interpreted the <hi>J, H, S,</hi> in the Cypher, to ſignifie as <hi>Latin</hi> Letters, <hi>Jeſuitae Habent Satis;</hi> and indeed we may be angry with him too, for we cannot think they have yet had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. The Chappel ſtands in a riſing Street, and one ſees it from below, which advantage
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94187:115"/> together with the height of it, makes it look great. In that place too the Street is wide, and gives room enough to view the Frontiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peice all at once, and with advantage to the proportions: to the bottom of that and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Chappel is an Aſcent from the Street of a great many Steps. I did not obſerve any Great Houſe belonging to it, their Houſe makes no ſhow, to their ſorrow. Over the Entrance of the Chappel, on the inſide which is at the <hi>Weſt,</hi> there are ſet up above the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Gallery four Pictures of <hi>Franciſcus Borgia;</hi> They are of a Wainſcoat colour, upon Boards, and the Boards are cut to the ſhape of the Pictures, they are all at the full length of a Man. At the bottom of each Picture is the Name of the Saint, for they have got him Canoniſed, and to the Name is added an Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium in a word; One is <hi>Franciſco Borgiae Juſto;</hi> the other add to his Name theſe 3 Epithets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, <hi>Prudenti, Temperanti, Forti.</hi> I could not obſerve that there was any thing added to the Picture which might be reckon'd a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of the Epithet, or Elogium under-written. This Chappel is lighter than that at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and I believe is much larger, but has not ſo much finery to ſhow, and looks very naked and plain. The Pillars, which ſupport the ſide Gallerys and the Roof, are very Great ones, and I believe there are 6 on a ſide, and tho' they are ſo big, they ſeem to be at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from one another. There are but few Pictures in the Chappel on the ſide Iſles; Thoſe that are there chiefly repreſent ſome Saints of their Order, with ſome Part of their Story. In one I took notice they have ſet <hi>Xaverius</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94187:115"/> upon the ground, as in a Wilderneſs, with two or three Leopards about him, and he is handling their Claws, and they fawning upon him. At the bottom of the Picture is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in <hi>Latin,</hi> ſignifying that He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>am'd the Savage Nations by the Faith of Chriſt. This <hi>Xaverius</hi> is a great Saint among them; but the ſcene of his Story is laid a great way off, even in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan:</hi> They call him the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the <hi>Indies</hi> and Martyr. He was put to death by the Magiſtracy in <hi>Japan;</hi> 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſome Villany or other, as we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough to ſuſpect; becauſe we find (as I ſhall have occaſion to take notice hereafter) that whatever any of this good Order are put to Death for any where, their Brethren make Martyrs of them, and ſay they died for the Catholick Faith. The <hi>Eaſt</hi> ends of the ſide Iſles have each of them an Altar very finely built up with Marble Pillars, and a good peice of Painting over them. That on the right ſide as we look up is dedicated to <hi>Xaverius;</hi> that on the left to <hi>Ignatius Loyola:</hi> Over the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Picture is written in Letters of Gold, <hi>Sancto Xaverio Sacrum;</hi> Over the latter, <hi>Sancto Ignatio Sacrum;</hi> and both, as I remember, leave out the mention of Almighty God. I doubt not but theſe Altars are deſign'd more for the Honour of theſe Men, than for the Glory of God. The peice of Painting over the high Altar repreſents the Fable of the Bleſſed Virgins Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. The Altar was at this time dreſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly fine, and rich, in appearance: Every thing ſhin'd with Silver and Gold; In the middle above the Altar, between ſix tall Silver Candleſticks ſtood two Angels, as tall as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94187:116"/> a Child of two years old, which ſeem'd to be Silver; with a Drapery thrown over the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of their bodies, which was guilt with Gold. Theſe put out each of them a hand, with which they ſupported between them a large Crown: This, too, ſeem'd to be Silver, and ſhin'd as if it were ſet with ſome precious Stones: The Angels turn'd their faces inward, and ſomewhat downward, as looking upon what was under the Crown. There ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it a tall, large Remonſtranter with the Hoſtie in it, which appear'd through the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal in the middle of it. Beſides theſe things there were ſet along over the Altar ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things for Ornament, which were gilt with Silver or Gold, and theſe were intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neatly with great Bundles of Flowers. The Ornament of the Table before, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſomething very fine, was of Scarlet Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, with a broad flouriſh along the top, and about the ends of it in manner of a Lace, which ſeem'd to be ſolid Silver, gilt with Gold. In the middle of the piece, it being now <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunday,</hi> according to the ſtile of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there was the Figure of a Dove, which ſeem'd alſo ſolid Silver, with Raies about it, which were an Embroidery of Gold. The company here at <hi>Compline</hi> was very ſmall.</p>
               <p>The Chappels of other Religious Houſes that we were in were neat, but none of them appear'd very rich or fine. The beſt we ſaw was that of the <hi>Minder Broeders</hi> or <hi>Minorites,</hi> which had a great many Altars, and a good Company of People. Their Quire is very cloſe, as is their uſual manner, We went through a dark Alley in the Church, to a door on the ſide of it, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94187:116"/> lookt in: There were a great Company of the Monks a ſinging their Service. The High Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar was very finely adorn'd with Silver Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Before an Altar which is <note place="margin">Lioſius.</note> on the left ſide as one goes in at the door of the Quire, at the <hi>Weſt</hi> end of it, which Altar I think is Dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> there lies a Tomb-ſtone, in which in Letters of Braſs is inlaid an Inſcription in <hi>Latin,</hi> which ſignifies, That what remains of <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> on Earth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Louvain</hi> has beſides the Churches of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orders but 5 Pariſh Churches. A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which would be much too ſmall for the City, even as 'tis now peopled, if all the People, as they ought to do, did attend the worſhip of God at their reſpective Pariſhes. But in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> People run where 'they will to confeſs, and to worſhip; and divide themſelves between the Secular, and the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Clergy: and the Congregations in the Chappels of the Religious Orders are properly ſo many ſeparate meetings of People, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Biſhop and his Presbyters, and put themſelves the name of Religious, as if they were eminently ſo, and call the other Secular, as if they were men of the common World.</p>
               <p>The chief of theſe 5 Churches is that of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> It is a Collegiate Church, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 18 Chanoines, a Preſident, and a Dean. It was <hi>Whit ſunday,</hi> as I have ſaid with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> when we were there. And according to Cuſtom all the Chanoines, and the Preſidents of the ſeveral Colleges appear'd
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94187:117"/> in their greateſt finery. Their Copes were very rich, being ſome of them Cloath of Silver, or Silver and Gold mixed, and cover'd with rich Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries of Gold and Silver; ſome few were of Silk well Embroider'd with Gold and Silver: They were about 40 perſons that were thus dreſs'd. They came out of the Quire two and two ſinging, with two Wax-Tapers burning carried before them, they marched ſinging out of the Church, but without the Hoſt, attended by the Bookſellers in their Gowns, who had a little Silver Mace carried before them; they had alſo in their train the Principal Magiſtrates and Officers of the Militia of the Town, and a guard of Souldiers. They went in proceſſion round the Church on the outſide, when they came in again they ſet themſelves in two rows along the middle Iſle and ſung a good while. Then they enter'd the Quire and took their ſeats, and the High Maſs for the day, which was celebrated with Muſick, begun. This was not celebrated at the High Altar, but at an Alter almoſt behind it, at a Chappel in the Paſſage round the outſide of the Quire, and was perform'd by the <hi>Capucines,</hi> who are favour'd with a Plenary Indulgence at this time, and which is to be obtain'd here. On the High Altar therefore there ſtood at this time under an Arch made for it, a Remonſtranter with the Wafer in it. This was a tall flouriſht work of the largeſt ſize of any that I had ſeen of the kind, and was very richly gilt with Gold. The peice of Painting here repreſented our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour as riſen from the dead, and giving the Keys to St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:94187:117"/>
               <p>On the right ſide of the High Altar, under one of the tall Arches which ſurrounded the Quire ſtood a ſort of a little Steeple of Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; It went up tapering with Pillars and Arches ſet as in ſeveral Stories one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the top of the Arch which it ſtood under. It was in many places gilt upon the Carv'd work of it, and lookt very fine. On the outſide it was encompaſs'd with high Braſs bars, to keep People at a little diſtance; on the top of them were a great many white Wax ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which I believe were more than a yard long, and gilt about in rings, but not lighted. I ſaw many People go to this place, drop down, and ſay a Prayer, and then away again; I askt a Townſman with us what was within there, for at that time we could not conveniently come near to ſee: He told me our Good Lord was there, by which he meant a Conſecrated Wafer; I afterwards had opportunity to go by the place, and ſaw a little Remonſtranter ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the middle of an Area, at the bottom of that building with a Wafer in the middle of it. It is uſual with them to call this Sacrament <hi>Our Good Lord,</hi> or <hi>our Good Lord God:</hi> This puts me in mind of what a Woman at <hi>Antwerp</hi> ſaid to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Servant, to give him warning to withdraw when the Sacrament was coming by: <hi>Lope Duyvel, Lope</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him) <hi>Onſe Lieve Heer Godt komt. Run Devil run, our Good Lord God comes;</hi> and down ſhe dropt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon her knees to receive the Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it paſs'd by: which doubtleſs ſhe was very fit for, having in the ſame minute revil'd, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a better Chriſtian than her ſelf, with the name of the Grand Enemy of Jeſus Chriſt. I
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94187:118"/> ſaw the ſame ſort of building again in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Church here, which was alſo there applied to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In this Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is a Chappel dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>Charles Borromeus:</hi> He was Arch-Biſhop <note place="margin">St. Charles Borromeus.</note> of <hi>Milain</hi> not very long ago, a ſecular Prieſt only, and of none of the Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, a Cardinal too, and yet in great repute in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for a mighty Saint. His family is one of the chiefeſt in the Dutchy of <hi>Milain.</hi> His Father Count <hi>Gilbert,</hi> married a Wife of the Houſe of the <hi>Medicis,</hi> who was Siſter to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. This Son <hi>Charles</hi> was born the ſecond of <hi>October,</hi> 1538; was made an Abbot at 16 Years of Age. In the Year 1560, when he was yet but 22 Years of Age, his Mothers Brother being by that time Pope under the name aforeſaid, this Nephew <hi>Charles</hi> was made Cardinal: While he was Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Milain,</hi> in the Year 1576 a terrible plague fell upon the City of <hi>Milain;</hi> which brought with it many other diſmal Calamities: He made himſelf much belov'd by the People for his Charity to the Sick and Poor at this time, and for the care that he took of them: The Plague did not ceaſe till the Year 1578: He ſtill continued among his People, viſited ſeveral that were ſick of the Diſeaſe, yet never was ſick of it himſelf. And now he is become, in the repute of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, a Patron a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Plague, and ſudden Deaths. In the Chappel here dedicated to him, there is a little Cheſt with a Cryſtal on the fide of it, through which one ſees ſomething, but I could not gueſs what it ſhould be; but this by an Inſcription is ſaid to be a Relick of St. <hi>Charles.</hi> On the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94187:118"/> of the Partition which encloſes the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſtands upon a Poſt a ſtrong Box lockt, with a hole to put Money in at, and by it a <hi>Dutch</hi> Rhime, ſignifying that, <hi>The beſt means to drive away from our ſelves the Plague, is to Honour St.</hi> Charles <hi>with Alms.</hi> There are Litanie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> hang'd up in Frames before a place to pray at, which the People are taught to ſay to St. <hi>Charles.</hi> In the ſame encloſure are contain'd alſo, as an Inſcription tells us, the Relicks of St. <hi>Dorothy,</hi> who is there ſaid to be a Patroneſs for breeding and Child-bearing Women. I cannot find how this comes about, or on what this eſteem of her is built, for ſhe was as ſtory ſays a Virgin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> commemorates her on the 6th of <hi>February,</hi> and in the Maſs for the Day, is this extravagant Prayer uſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grant O Lord we may obtain the Pardon of our Sins, by the Interceſſion of the Bleſſed</hi> Dorothy, <hi>Virgin and Martyr, who was always acceptable to Thes, by the merit of her Chaſtity, and by the Profeſſion which ſhe made of thy Vertue; through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is evident by this, and many other of their Prayers, that they even equal the Saints to our Saviour in the Office of Mediation. Here they ask the greateſt benefit, Pardon of Sin, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of her Interceſſion; and this Interceſſion of hers they expect ſhall prevail by the merit of her Chaſtity and Vertue. Sometimes they mention the ſufferings of Martyrs, as what they hope ſhall prevail for them, and even ſatisfie for their Sins. Which things ſhow how much they differ from true Chriſtianity, which, as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94187:119"/> the Apoſtle has taught us, acknowledges but one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>At an Altar of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in this Church, theſe Compliments are given her by Inſcriptions about it: <hi>Sedes Sapientiae,</hi> and again <hi>Virgo Maria Illuminatrix.</hi> Let it be judg'd whether theſe are not Attributes that ſignifie ſomething may be expected from the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf, and that it is not true what the explaining People of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, That they only pray to the Saints to pray for them. When the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is call'd the <hi>Seat of Wiſdom,</hi> and an <hi>Inlightner,</hi> would not any one who believes this of her think that he might expect Wiſdom and Illumination from her? And when a Saint is call'd a Patron in ſuch and ſuch particular Caſes, the People are led to underſtand that 'tis the Saint that helps in ſuch caſes by vertue of a Power given him from Almighty God. For if praying and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding be all their buſineſs, one Saint may pray for any thing as well as another.</p>
               <p>In this Church there is an Altar dedicated to the Holy Trinity, as an Inſcription tells us in theſe words, <hi>Deo Triuno Sacrum.</hi> The Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peice is a Picture, ſuch as they uſually make, for the diſhonourable, and Impious Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the H. Trinity. One ſees painted an old Man ſitting in the Clouds with a tripple Crown on his Head, a younger Man ſits by him on his right hand, holding a Croſs, and over them is a Pigeon hovering with a Glory about it.</p>
               <p>The Church of St. <hi>Michael</hi> is ſaid to be the oldeſt in <hi>Louvain.</hi> It ſtands upon the Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Wall, and the Gate-way through the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94187:119"/> Wall goes under the Church. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon one cannot think that this was the firſt Church built here; becauſe no People would have ſet their Church upon the outermoſt Wall of the City, as this was at firſt. By a Printed Paper poſted up within the Portal of this Church; it was ſaid, That a plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence was to be obtain'd there, by all thoſe who ſhall come and offer at the Altar of the Holy Trinity, on the Feaſt and Octave of the H. Trinity, which was now approaching, for the Redemption of Chriſtian Slaves out of the hands of the <hi>Turks.</hi> And thoſe of the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the Holy Trinity who ſhould come hither for this purpoſe, were to enjoy all the Indulgences, Benefits, Priviledges which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and are granted to the Fraternity of the Cord of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> or to that of the <hi>Roſary,</hi> or that of the Girdle of St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Very much, but perhaps not all worth two pence. Within the Church is an Altar to the Holy Trinity, which ſeems much out of repair, and deſerted; for which reaſon perhaps the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid bait is laid to draw People hither: There is a wretched Image of an Old Man, over it, which was all I could make out: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe it ſtands ſomewhat dark. This Church is but mean in all reſpects. There are in it two or three Altars to St. <hi>Michael,</hi> where we ſee an ugly Image of him treading upon a Dragon. By one of theſe Altars is a Box to receive Money, and by it an Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſays, That Offerings of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irty ſhould be given there to the Angel St. <hi>Michael,</hi> that he may ſtand by us in the time of our need: And he is there ſaid to be
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94187:120"/> the Patron againſt the Head-ach, and burning Feavers.</p>
               <p>We had ſpent as much time here as we could afford, and were endeavouring to get from hence to <hi>Namur.</hi> We found that there was no ſtated Carriage between theſe two places: That we could not hire our Carriage for our ſelves, but at an unreaſonable rate; and no man cared indeed to carry us that way, it being out of the Road of buſineſs at preſent. But to <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> or <hi>Bruſſels</hi> we might go; becauſe this was the time of year for uſing the Waters of <hi>Aix la Chapelle;</hi> and this occaſion'd them a great deal of employment in that Road. We had not ſecur'd our places in the Coach for <hi>Namur</hi> from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and muſt perhaps have been forc'd to ſtay there longer than we could afford if we had gone back thither, and ſo we reſolv'd to go from hence for <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that perhaps we might from thence go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently for <hi>Namur.</hi> This paſſage they reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd to us at 14 Hours, but by reaſon of the badneſs of the Ways, and the ſlowneſs of their travelling we made it I believe near 20 hours, for it took us up two long days to get to <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi>

               <p>ON <hi>Whitmonday,</hi> according to the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtile, we took our places in a <hi>Charrette</hi> that was bound for <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi> We were in all 6 or 8 Perſons in the <hi>Charrette,</hi> and were drawn by 3 Horſes: We paid each perſon, for this paſſage, two Pattacoons at 48 Stivers each, which came to 9 Guilders 12 Stivers for two of us. We began our Journey about 11 a Clock before Noon, went through a great part of the City, and out at the <hi>Thienen Port:</hi> ſo we left <hi>Park Abby</hi> a little on our left hand. This is a Houſe belonging to the Order of the <hi>Premonſtratenſes,</hi> who were taken notice of before at <hi>Antwerp.</hi> The place ſtill retains the Name it had before it was taken to this Uſe. The Houſe ſtands in a Park, a place made very pleaſant by a little Wood near it, and fine Fiſh-ponds, a little Brook, and curious Meadows. This account is given of the place, and tho' we could not ſee it, I think fit to mention it becauſe this Houſe has been Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with the Preſence of our King, who ſeveral times lodg'd here during the late War.</p>
               <p>Through all this Journey to <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> we often ſaw the miſerable Effects of War: A Country of a rich and Arable Soil fit to bear Corn, but much of it untill'd: Many Houſes ruin'd, and others made uninhabitable: And it ſeem'd to me that the Country is. much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted of its People. It may be ſuppoſed
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94187:121"/> that during the War many were forced into the Armies on one ſide and the other, and in them deſtroy'd; and many of the People might be fled into other Countries for the ſafety of their Lives, and be ſtill begging or working there for their lively-hood. This Country is generally open Champion Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and but too Commodious for the march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Armies, as the poor Inhabitants have had reaſon to think.</p>
               <p>About the middle of this Days Journey we came to <hi>Thienen</hi> or <hi>Tilmont;</hi> which is a little <note place="margin">Thienen.</note> City ſcituate upon the River <hi>Gheet.</hi> This C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty, to go round it by the Wall, is, they ſay, about a Mile in compaſs: The Wall ſeem'd at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but in a ruinous condition, we alſo ſaw many Ruines within, and many Houſes almoſt ſo. The River runs through this City, they ſay, under 12 Bridges. There are 7 diſtinct Markets, that is, Market-places, for ſeveral things, according to the manner of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and the City ſtands in a rich fruitful Country which is able to afford it all things neceſſary to Humane Life. It has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a City of Great Trade, and was the Head City of one of the Quarters of <hi>Brabant;</hi> but that dignity has been long transferr'd from hence to <hi>Hertogen-boſch,</hi> and now this City is within that Quarter, which acknowledges <hi>Louvain</hi> for Head of it. There are two Churches obſervable in it, which are Stately and Magnificent buildings, the only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſigns perhaps of its former Grandure. One is dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which ſtands upon a very wide open place: It is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94187:121"/> not fine within, for without doubt the City is but poor. There had been a Proceſſion on that day, or perhaps on <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> wherein had been carried the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and that of a Biſhop, whom I ſuppoſe to be St. <hi>Germain.</hi> Theſe Images ſtood in the Church, on the things by which they carry them on mens ſhoulders. They were but little Images, but dreſs'd very fine; their upper Garments were both the ſame, of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-Sattin, with many and large flowers of Gold wove in with it: By their ſtanding ſtill in the Church, I concluded they were to be carried again on ſome other day of the Octave, which is that they ſometimes do. I went alſo into the Church of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> who is ſaid to have been Biſhop of <hi>Paris.</hi> Here is a Quire wherein they were ſinging Veſpers, it ſeem'd very naked and mean with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. At ſome of the Altars in the other part of the Church, the Ornament ſet before them, was good freſh Silk, with large and frequent Gold Flowers upon it. We ſtaid here but an Hour, went through the City; paſſing by the end of one Street we ſaw it wide, and the Houſes in a pretty good condition, but thoſe in our way were all very miſerable</p>
               <p>When we were gone a little way out of <hi>Thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Our Lady of the Stone.</note> we ſaw a Chappel built of Brick, with the Rubbiſh and Ruines of ſome other building about it. This Chappel has an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> call'd <hi>Notredame de Pierre,</hi> or <hi>Our Lady of the Stone,</hi> which is in great Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Eſteem with the People of this Country: our Honeſt foreman rode by it with his Hat in his lap for a good way together.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94187:122"/> As we were paſſing, our Company all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd in giving us this following account of this Image. It was at firſt found ready ſhaped and form'd in a Rock; but I asked, and they could not tell me when this was: But when found firſt, it was not above a ſpan long; but it has grown ever ſince, and does grow ſtill, for it ſeems it is not yet got to the full bigneſs of an ordinary Woman, tho' as they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it, ſhe was grown a very great Girl. They told us, ſhe grows almoſt an Inch in height every Year, and then they did well not to ſay when ſhe was firſt found; for at that rate of growing, if ſhe had been long there, the little Chappel would not have held her.</p>
               <p>To this Image, People come for relief againſt the Stone or Gravel, and in time of Peace this Chappel is much frequented, eſpecially upon particular Days, at which times I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome Indulgences are the Lure to draw People to it. They told us, that on <hi>Eaſter Monday</hi> laſt, the Country now being quiet, there were reckon'd 7000 People, who came to pay their Devotions here. This ſilly Story was told us, with a great deal of gravity and ſeriouſneſs, and we, to encourage them to give us ſuch accounts of things as we paſs'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it with as much gravity, and ſeeming admiration: Upon which a good Man in the Company, who came from <hi>Berg</hi> St. <hi>Winoc,</hi> and was going to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aths of <hi>Aix,</hi> told us, They have at <hi>Bullen</hi> an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which came thither in a Ship alone.</p>
               <p>The ſame Man when the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were telling that it was good to Pray at this Image againſt the Stone; ſaid, Yes, yes,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94187:122"/> ſhe is the Mother, ſhe cannot fail: intimating that which 'tis without doubt the People ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally imagine, that ſhe as a Mother may ſtill pretend to have ſome Authority and Regard with our Saviour: Indeed they muſt needs be betray'd into this Opinion, by the extravagant Prerogatives which are given to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in the Devotions to her, which the Prieſts teach them, and by ſeeing our Saviour for the moſt part repreſented as a Child in her Arms: As if he were ſtill in a condition of ſubjection to Her; who is now poſſeſt of all power in Heaven and Earth, and is Head over all things.</p>
               <p>But by the eſteem of this Image, it is eaſie to judge whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> reckons there is any Vertue in Images or not; and whether or no the Papiſts put any truſt in them. Can it be ſaid they believe there is no vertue in this Image, when they pretend it Cures the Stone? And do they put no truſt in it, who come an hundred Mile perhaps to this place, in hopes to be Cur'd here of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper? And can we find any Inſtances of Veneration paid by the <hi>Heathens</hi> to their Images, beyond what is practiſed and taught in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>? The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mechlin</hi> in his Paſtoral Letter directs; That the Images of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that are famous for Miracles ſhould be frequented; that they be carried about, after the manner of our Anceſtours, ſays he, in publick Proceſſions, that they be illuſtrated with lighted Flambeaus, and honour'd with ſtated Eauds, Litanies and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. A direction which would far better have become a <hi>Heathen</hi> Prieſt than a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Biſhop.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:94187:123"/>
               <p>After about two hours Travel more, we came <note place="margin">Leeuwe.</note> to another little City call'd <hi>Leeuwe.</hi> We went, to this for a good way upon an old broken pitch'd Cauſe-way. The ground about this City is flat and low: At a diſtance the Meadows ſeem very wet and ſoft, which is the reaſon of this made way; but as we came nearer the City the wet ſeem'd to encreaſe, and about the City there ſeems to be a perfect Moraſs or Bog. There were ſome out-works, ſet here and there upon ſome dry ſpots in it. We found the Gates ruin'd, the Walls in a very ruinous condition, and many heaps of Rubbiſh about in the Town within. It is now, whatever it may have been formerly, a very wretch'd place. This City is within the Quarter of <hi>Louvain,</hi> but juſt upon the Borders of it; for ſoon after we were gone from this place we entred upon the Dominions of the Prince of <hi>Leige.</hi> There was a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gariſon now in the Town; who had deckt their Guard houſe with Boughs, and hung their Colours out at the Windows: We found alſo the Streets ſtrow'd with freſh Greens; which things were the ſigns of a Proceſſion that had been there this Day. A good big Bell was calling People to Church, and they were haſtening to catch I ſuppoſe the Benediction at <hi>Compline.</hi> We did not alight nor ſtop here. When we were out of the City we paſt by a pretty large Lake, which was on our left hand, at a little diſtance from us, and lies very near the Walls of the City on that ſide.</p>
               <p>Near this City, at the diſtance of about two Hours, was fought the famous Battle of <hi>Landen;</hi> in the Year 1693, in which <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> General, in his laſt Campaign, won the Field,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94187:123"/> and loſt his Army; he might indeed pretend ſome right to it when it was ſtrow'd with the Dead Bodies of his beſt and boldeſt Troops, who were chiefly his <hi>Switzers.</hi> And he had reaſon to be very pertinacious in the Caſe, tho' he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his men to a Prodigious ſlaughter; ſor the double number which he had to that of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,</hi> would have doubled his ſhame at leaſt, if he had ſuffer'd himſelf to be beat off. He therefore puſh'd on his own men to be kill'd, as long as the Ammunition of the <hi>Confederates</hi> laſted, and then thoſe he had left kept the Field.</p>
               <p>About an Hour after we left <hi>Leeuwe,</hi> we came <note place="margin">St. <hi>Tryden.</hi>
                  </note> to St. <hi>Truyden,</hi> which was to be our reſting place for this night. This was, they ſay, in ancient times the chief City of thoſe <hi>Gauls,</hi> whom <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> calls <hi>Centrones,</hi> and of whom he has much to ſay. This perhaps may be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the corrupted name, which ſome in late times have given to this City, calling it St. <hi>Tron.</hi> The name of St. <hi>Truyden</hi> it has from the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Trudo,</hi> which is here. It is a Monaſtery of the <hi>Benedictines.</hi> This City with a Territory about it almoſt to the Gates of <hi>Leeuwe,</hi> is ſubject to the Prince of <hi>Leige:</hi> But half the City is the revenue of the Abbot of this Monaſtery; and when the Magiſtrates of the City are choſen, this Abbot chuſes an equal number with the Prince We came late to Town, and all Churches were ſhut: the doors of this Monaſtery were juſt then ſhutting, ſo we could ſee nothing within. Indeed the mean appearance of the outſide of all things here made us the leſs curious or deſirous to ſee the Inſide of any Places. One Church there was whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Almoſt all the Houſes we ſaw here lookt old and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. We lodg'd in a Houſe that ſeem'd to have a good deal of room, but it was very ill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated: Our Chamber had 4 pittiful Beds in it, and all of them were poſſeſs'd.</p>
               <p>We willingly left this wretched place betimes <note place="margin">Borchloen</note> the next Morning, and took our way for <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> through the Cities of <hi>Borchloen</hi> and <hi>Tongeren;</hi> both within the Principallity of <hi>Leige. Borchloen</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Lootz,</hi> has ſome Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over the neighbouring Villages in a little compaſs: And theſe are known to have belong'd to it, up as high as to the time of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi> and before that. It was formerly with thoſe Villages call'd the County of <hi>Droſtein</hi> from the Lords of that name, to whom the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd. It appear'd now a miſerable, poor, and ruinous place, and to have nothing worth obſerving. We paſt through it without ſtopping.</p>
               <p>We went on to <hi>Tongeren,</hi> and there ſtaid an hour or two to refreſh our ſelves. This City is <note place="margin">Tongeren.</note> miſerable, old, and ſmall now; but was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, if we could have ſtaid, to have been well view'd and conſider'd, for the old ruines that are about it. We obſerv'd ſeveral pelces of great Stone Walls, which evidently enough ſhow'd that they had belong'd to ſomething more Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent than the ſorry buildings that now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them. Having a little time after Dinner, I went out and obſerv'd a great deal of this in going to the Church, which I would have
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94187:124"/> ſeen, but it was ſhut. There is now a Wall about the City, but ruinous, as well as the Gates of it, and of but little compaſs. It lies upon a little River, call'd the <hi>Jecker,</hi> which comes down from <hi>Borchworm,</hi> having had its riſe not far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that, and from <hi>Tongeren</hi> it runs down to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> where it enters the <hi>Maeſe.</hi> This City has its name (as <hi>Munſter</hi> ſays, tho' ſome give it a much higher Original) from a People of <hi>Germany</hi> call'd <hi>Tungri,</hi> who were the firſt of them that paſs'd the <hi>Rhine.</hi> They paſs'd, it ſeems, the <hi>Maeſe</hi> too; and poſſeſſing a vaſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try here about, built here their Chief or Head City: Many Cities in <hi>Brabant,</hi> either built by this People, or Conquer'd by them, were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this. It has been the Seat of a Race of Kings, who had a great extent of Dominion. Thoſe Princes call'd the <hi>Pepins,</hi> from whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended the famous <hi>Charlemagin,</hi> deriv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Race of theſe Kings. It is very probable that this Dominion extended it ſelf over great part of <hi>Brabant,</hi> the County of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> and even to <hi>Cologne:</hi> The Memorials of which are thought to be ſeveral Towns ſcatter'd about, in this Tract of Land, whoſe names re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that of <hi>Tongeren:</hi> As <hi>Tongerheim,</hi> near <hi>Colen; Tongerloo,</hi> a Town far from hence in <hi>Brabant,</hi> near <hi>Herentals;</hi> And <hi>Tongrin</hi> in the Province of <hi>Namur.</hi> It is not to be doubted but <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Natural Hiſtory ſpeaks of the <hi>Spaa</hi> Water, which he puts within the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this City, and which lies in the Province of <hi>Leige,</hi> between the <hi>Maeſe</hi> and the <hi>Rhine.

It is, however, certain that this has been a Great, Populous, and Royal City. It was ſackt by the Cruel <hi>Attila,</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> when he Invaded theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; He put to the Sword as Hiſtory tell us, all that he found in it, and threw down, among other Buildings, more than an Hundred Churches; by which we may judge of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it at that time. Being ſomewhat reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd and rebuilt after this Calamity, tho' it could never attain its former Grandeur, it was deſtroy'd again by the Incurſions of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Normans,</hi> in the time of <hi>Charles The Bald.</hi> This deſtruction it never recover'd, and has now no remains of its former greatneſs; but only, in Venerable ruines: which ſhow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, many without, and ſome within the preſent City. Such miſeries are the common attendants of War; when the juſt Providence of God lets looſe the Rage and Fury of Men to execute his Vengeance upon one another, they

                  <hi>Tongeren</hi> was the firſt City of all <hi>Gaul</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> that embrac'd the Chriſtian Faith; This it did chiefly by the care and Preaching of St. <hi>Maternus,</hi> about the Year of our Lord, 101. This Perſon was born in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> he came hither to Preach the Goſpel, was the firſt Biſhop of the place, and died in the Year 138. The laſt and 9th Biſhop of the <hi>Tongriens</hi> was <hi>Valentinus;</hi> He died in the Year 308: From which time St. <hi>Servatius</hi> transfer'd the Epiſcopal See, from hence to <hi>Maeſtricht:</hi> from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it was transfer'd, as we ſhall ſee hereafter by St. <hi>Hubert</hi> to <hi>Liege,</hi> in the Year 713.</p>
               <p>This Afternoon we paſs'd through an open Champion Country and pretty high for the moſt part; and from whence we could ſee <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> for a good while before we came to it. The Soil is all good, an excellent Mold, and fit for Corn, ſome was Plough'd and Sown; but it was evident that the uſe of the Country had been neglected for ſome time. And accordingly, tho' this is a Corn Country we met ſeveral Carts loaden with Corn that were coming up from <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> to ſerve the Country: From thence too they are furniſht with Coals, for there ſeems to be little Wood in theſe parts. In theſe wide Fields we met with frequent little buildings of Brick, about the bigneſs of ſuch as are built ſometimes over a Ditch, for an occaſion not to be mention'd. In theſe we could ſee through a Grate ſtood an Altar, and over it an Image of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94187:126"/> the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> To theſe, in paſſing by, the People paid their reſpects. By every one of theſe we ſhould ſee at leaſt one fair flouriſhing Tree, tho' there was not perhaps another in ſeveral Miles round about, ſo that we knew and could expect before we came to it, that we ſhould after a while ſee a Chappel, by ſeeing at firſt only the top of the Tree. This way of honouring a Sacred place with Trees, which were Sacred too, is an old cuſtom deriv'd from the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who in their notions of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had corrupted Religion; for they pretended that a ſort of Deities were lodg'd in thoſe Trees, and dwelt there as long as the Trees laſted. For which and perhaps other Corruptions, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the <hi>Jews</hi> the planting any Trees about his Altars. The Sky grew diſmal black upon us, while we were in theſe naked Fields, and Rain'd hard upon us all the way to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> to which we came, about half an hour after ſix. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued raining ſo that we could not ſtir out that Evening from our Lodging.</p>

               <p>THIS City call'd in Latin, <hi>Trajectum ad Moſam,</hi> in the Language of the Country <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> deriv'd its name undoubtedly from hence; that this was a common place of Paſſage over the <hi>Maeſe.</hi> It ſtands upon this great River, which is here, much wider than the breadth of the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> and of a depth ſufficient to bring up loaded Veſſels of a good Burden.

               <p>This City is ſeated within the Biſhoprick of <hi>Leige,</hi> but is with ſome compaſs about it reckon'd a part of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and as ſuch did formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Dukes of <hi>Brabant,</hi> who divided it with the Biſhop and Prince of <hi>Leige.</hi> The ground and occaſion of this odd diviſion is this. <hi>Porus</hi> Count of <hi>Louvain</hi> gave part of this City to St. <hi>Servatius,</hi> when he was Biſhop of it, to be held with ſome acknowledgment of the Gift: for it was He, as hath been ſaid, who transferr'd the Epiſcopal Seat from <hi>Tongeren</hi> hither, after he had been Inſtrumental to Convert the People here to the Chriſtian Faith. When, after this, the See was transfer'd to <hi>Leige,</hi> the right which the Biſhop had when he reſided here was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd to belong to him when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to <hi>Leige,</hi> and does ſo ſtill. But now the Dominion of the City is divided between the States General of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Leige:</hi> the former being in Poſſeſſion of the rights of the Duke of <hi>Brabant.</hi> This double Juriſdiction is ſtill continued in the City, and as formerly, without any diſtinction by bounds or limits; ſo that the Subjects of one and the other Government lie intermix'd about the City. In the ſame Street there are Subjects to the different Governments. A cuſtom has been formerly obſerv'd, and I think is ſtill here:
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94187:127"/> That if à Man who is a Subject of one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment takes a Wife that is a Subject of the other, His Children by her muſt all be Subjects to that Government that ſhe was under. It is alſo ſaid that if any Stranger comes to ſettle in this City, he muſt in the firſt place chuſe which of the two Governments he will be under, and muſt ſo remain as long as he is here. There are two diſtinct Burgomaſters in the City, and other Magiſtrates to govern the diſtinct People: but in common concerns of the City, they meet and join together in determining matters. The Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> was, notwithſtanding this Sate of the City, reckon'd the chief Soveraign of it, and at preſent the States General ſeem to have the greateſt power here. There was now a great Garriſon in the Town, conſiſting of Ten Thouſand Men, which we were told were all in the States pay: They then, by conſequence, have the Command of the Gates, the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and the Amunition. This City is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly well fortified; beſides a ſtrong Wall, and a broad deep Ditch, there are ſeveral Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions round it, which are well planted with Cannon; there are alſo many ſtrong out-works, with cover'd ways to them, and all theſe are provided of Mines ready made. There is an Hill on the <hi>South Eaſt</hi> ſide of the Town which lies ſomewhat near, and within reach to annoy it conſiderably; but againſt that they have rais'd a Baſtion there to a great height, which is a good defence to the Town, and this is within the Walls. This is altogether a fine City, the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are good, after the common manner of theſe Countries, and really all things look in a thriving flouriſhing Condition; the Streets are generally very broad.</p>

               <p>The Hill before mention'd on the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Quarries.</note> ſide of this City, yeilds a very pleaſant proſpect to it in time of Peace, and when they expect no miſchief from thence. It is all cover'd with a good Mold, and full of Encloſures, which are Plough'd and Sown, and veild very good Grain. The inſide of this Hill is a Free-ſtone, in which are a multitude of Caverns, out of which they have dug Stone, and paſſages wide enough for for Carts to come in and fetch it thence. The Stone is white with a little yellowiſhneſs: 'tis in the Quarry ſo ſoft, that I could make an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on it eaſily with the end of my Cane; but when it is out it hardens and bears the Weather very well. We went to ſee this place which they call the <hi>Quarries;</hi> We took a Guide from one of the houſes at the bottom of the Hill, who furniſht himſelf with a Candle, and ſeveral Matches, and a good piece of Touch-wood fir'd. We mounted about a third part of the height of the Hill, and then at a Cart way went into it; when we were in, our Guide lighted his Candle. We obſerv'd there were ſeveral paſſages which run from the way in which we went, and in many places we ſaw great Caverns out of which the Stone had been dug; we had a good big Candle, yet the light of it did not reach the ſides of them, tho' they are whitiſh too. He led us to one place where a round hole is cut for the Air, down into the Quarry; we had aſcended conſiderably within the Quarry, and this hole did not come
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94187:129"/> down from the higheſt part of the Hill, yet I believe it was of the depth of 3 or 4 good Stories. The roof is every where dug in an Arch. There are ſo many paſſages and ways and wide Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns here dug into the Rock, that I believe if our Candle had gone out, and we could not have lighted it again, it would have been hard for our Guide, tho' well acquainted with the place, to have led us out. He brought usto a place within the Hill where there is ſome Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but how it comes there I could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; he call'd it the <hi>Put,</hi> which is <hi>Dutch</hi> for a Well. A Wall was built up before it almoſt to the top of the Cavity which is here, as high as a good lofty Ceiling, ſo we could not ſee the manner of it: But he convinced us there was Water within, by throwing a piece of a Stone over the Wall; this he did ſeveral times, the Stones ſtruck dry firſt and then quickly fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Water. I imagine this to be a Cavity in the Rock, to which the Rain water that ſoaks through the Mold is gather'd. He could not tell me whether it was a running Water or not, and I liſtned, but could hear no noiſe of any motion it had: beſides I judge it has no motion by the name they gave it; for if it had been a ſubterraneous Stream, they would have call'd it the <hi>Stroom,</hi> or the <hi>Beeck,</hi> not a <hi>Put</hi> or Well. Sometimes we climb'd up by notches in the Rock, out of which they had hewn Stone a good way, and ſometimes we deſcended by ſuch notches. When we had walked about half an hour under ground, and were told there was nothing to be ſeen more, but ſuch as we had ſeen, we deſir'd to be led out. He brought us after a little while to another Cart-way, out at the ſide of the Hill, which I believe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94187:130"/> another third part higher than that we enter'd at. This Hill by Vertue of this Stone is a great advantage to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> for they uſe it much in Building themſelves, and by the help of the River they convey it to their Neighbours.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MAY</hi> the 22d, we went on Board the <hi>Marckt-Schip,</hi> as 'tis call'd, which goes from <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> to <hi>Leige,</hi> being ſtill deſirous to ſee <hi>Namur.</hi> There goes off ſuch a Boat as this every day from hence for <hi>Leige,</hi> about 9 a Clock in the morning. We paid for our fraight, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Roof, 9 Stivers for each perſon. We went on board about 9 a Clock; to ſecure our ſelves places under the Roof, for the Weather was rainy. It is a large flat bottom'd Boat, cover'd at each end, and open in the middle, the open part is more then one third of the Boat. We were told it would be a paſſage of about 5 Hours: but we went off before ten in the Morning, and came not to <hi>Leige</hi> till 7 in the Evening. I reckon this muſt be imputed to the ſwelling of the River, by the great Rains which had fallen, by reaſon of which it run with the greater force againſt us, and our Horſes were much the oftner in the Water, and ſometimes very deep in it, at which times we mov'd very ſlowly. We were drawn by 5 Horſes faſtned at the end of a very long Rope; I believe we had for the moſt part about an hundred People on Board. But all the way at ſeveral places we had ſome delays by ſome People going off, and others coming on. We had a Sail ſet up, but it help'd us little, becauſe there was very little wind.</p>
               <p>The Mountain in which were the Quarries
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94187:130"/> that we were in runs to the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> and butts upon it with a precipice for a great way toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and we were cloſe under it as we went up, our Horſes going on the brink of the River at the foot of it. I could obſerve here the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how the Stone lies in it. I ſaw it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in layings one over another of very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thickneſſes; one laying which was about the middle of the height, as I remember, was I believe 5 or 6 feet in thickneſs, ſome others not above two. The layings of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were ſeperated from one another, by a laying of Flints which run all along between them, of the thickneſs I ſuppoſe of 4 or 5 Inches, commonly. After we had gone for ſome hours by this Mountain, it left the River and turn'd up into he Country, but continu'd, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd there very high, with a gradual aſcent, and cloath'd with green Downs fit for Sheep. It left a rich plain between it and the River of different breadths. As far as the Mountain on that ſide of us run by the River, the other ſide was a Flatt, and we could ſee no riſing ground but at a great diſtance from the River, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of a diſtinct View. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when we came to have a flat ground on the right ſide of us as we went up, we had a riſing ground on the other, the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſide of the River; this-began I think about <hi>Viſet</hi> or <hi>Weſet,</hi> and continued all the way up from thence. Sometimes the Hills riſe gradually to a great height, and ſhow'd rich encloſed grounds, a great many, one above another, in a mixture of Corn fields, Orchards, and Paſture-Grounds. Sometimes the Hill ſtood up very high, with a precipice almoſt hanging over the Water: here appear'd a Rock of a ſort of Marble; it is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94187:131"/> a very hard Stone, of a deep blew colour, and will poliſh very ſmooth; there is much of it in this Country, and much is uſed for Stairs or Pavements, where it never wears, as well as for other parts of buildings. Sometimes where the Hill was very high and ſteep, it was yet cover'd with mold, and that all Planted with Vineyards from the top almoſt to the bottom; theſe were new dreſs'd and ſtuck all over with the little Stakes which the Wires of the Vines were to lay hold on, and ſo to hold up the Grapes a little from the Ground. There are a great many of theſe Vineyards in the way, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Leige</hi> it ſelf. This had been an extream pleaſant paſſage if we could have been ſure of good weather, and could have ſtood in the open part of the Boat; for we had but little Windows in the Roof to look out at.</p>

It is a very good, black, and ſhining Coal. We obſerved both here, and at <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and at <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> a frugality in the uſe of this Coal, which ſeems worth taking notice of. The moſt of it is in great peices, it being as it were hewn out of a Rock: but in the working of theſe out, and in the removing them from place to place, there will be a great deal of Coal duſt made. This duſt they carefully preſerve, and uſe it thus. They take a certain ſort of a fat Clay, which looks ſomewhat of the colour of brick Earth, and make it into a Morter, working it with a convenient quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: being thus prepar'd, they mingle the Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt with it, as much as it will receive, and work the whole Maſs well together. When they have done ſo, they with their hands make up the mingled ſtuff into Oval balls, ſomewhat leſſer than Bricks. Theſe they lay to dry and harden, and then they burn them. They ſeem to take fire but ſlowly, and to need, for this, the mixture of ſome of the pure Coal among them, but when they are well kindled they give a great heat, and they hold fire a long time: They look of the colour of Bricks when
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94187:132"/> burnt and cold again. At <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> we obſerv'd they ſtuck this ſtuff up againſt the Wall in Cakes to dry there, and there it would ſtick very faſt, till they beat it down for their uſe. The Coal Mines which are chiefly uſed at preſent here, are ſaid to be very rich, and not above a League diſtant from the City: They afford beſides what is ſpent here, and in the Neighbouring parts, enough to ſell to other Countries at a cheap rate, for an hundred thouſand Crowns Yearly.</p>

There are ſome Vineyards above the City at the top, and on the ſteepeſt part of the Hill, within the compaſs of the Wall. The Streets of the City have no beauty, they are very narrow, and few of them ſtrait; the buildings are much like the Old City of <hi>London.</hi> They are commonly 3 or 4 Stories in height, but thoſe Stories are not very high ones. The New buildings, which are the repair of the Miſchief which the Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> did with his Bombs in the late War, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally built after the common new Faſhion, and like our new buildings in <hi>London;</hi> they are moſtly built with Brick, or Stone. It was but a very ſmall part of the Town which was hurt, in proportion to the whole. It is chiefly a little tract from St. <hi>Lamberts</hi> Church down to the Water-ſide, and along by the Water, ſomewhat above and below the Bridge to the <hi>Wyke.</hi> The City Houſe was ruin'd. The front Wall of it is good part, ſtanding; it does not ſeem by the remainders to have been a very great or Magnificent Building: It ſtood upon the Great Market as it is call'd; which is indeed the wideſt and moſt ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94187:135"/> place that we ſaw in this City, but not very big.</p>
               <p>We went up a very long Street, and a ſteep Hill to the Cittadel which ſtands above the whole City: Where having ask'd leave of the Corporal, who was then in Duty there, we were permitted to walk upon the brow of the Hill, which overlooks the whole City, and views the Country for a good way about, upwards and down the River. Here we could ſee the ſhort turn which the River makes. Our proſpect was for the moſt part bounded with Hills, that were near enough for us to view diſtinctly what is upon them. We ſaw ſome which ſhow'd at the ſteep ſides of them the Rocks, which lifted them ſo high: But the greateſt part of our proſpect preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our ſight a rich and uſeful Country. The ſides of the Hills cover'd with Vineyards, the tops with Corn Fields; the lower grounds were divided between Meadows, Hop-grounds, of which we ſaw many, and Orchards and Gardens; we ſee all this intermixed with many Houſes, and ſome little Villages; it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of the moſt various and delightful proſpects that which we had here: VVe lookt down from hence over the tops of the Steeples in the City. If our time, and the fear of Rain would have permitted, we could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have ſtaid a great while here. We went down from hence into the City ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, on purpoſe to go through a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, which we ſaw below us, to obſerve ſomething of the manner of ſuch a thing which was new to us, and went down a very ſteep deſcent by it, which was made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the more eaſie by ſteps of Stone laid
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94187:135"/> into the Hill, but not without ſome care for our Necks.</p>
               <p>This City is plentifully furniſht with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Springs of delicate Water: Theſe feed ſome publick Fountains which run continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Many private Houſes have a good Spring to ſerve them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Leige</hi> there are 8 Collegiate Churches, 34 Parochial Churches, and of thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to religious Houſes, ſo many as to make the number amount to above an Hundred in all.</p>
               <p>The great Church of the City is Dedicated <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Church and Treaſury of St.</hi> Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</note> to St. <hi>Lambert,</hi> who was mention'd before; and he is honour'd as the Patron, or Protector of the City. There is by it a large Cloyſter which goes round a Garden-Platt, that is now neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. The Arch'd Roof of one ſide of the four that the Cloyſter conſiſts of, was beat with the Bombs. The Church is very large, but has little Finery in it. At the Weſt end is a Chappel to St. <hi>Lambert,</hi> at the bottom of the broad middle Iſle, with the Altar ſet within againſt the Partition. We got Admiſſion into the Quire upon our deſire, to ſee there the Treaſure of St. <hi>Lambert:</hi> What was ſhown us for this is as follows. After they that ſhow'd it had taken away from above the Altar at each end a Silk Curtain, and behind that two boards, there appear'd two things in Silver which were wrought into the form of a Church; they were ſet one over another, and ſeem'd to be all the four about 3 Feet long, and a Foot and half in height. One of them had a blew Enamel (as I ſuppoſe, for we kept with other Viewers a due diſtance) in ſeveral Partitions upon it: They did not ſtir theſe from the Places,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94187:136"/> and they were ſet ſo that if they had Ends, or another ſide of Silver, we could not ſee it; and therefore I do not doubt, but we ſaw all of them, that was to be ſeen. There were three Men about the ſhowing of theſe, one with a Surplice on, and the other two in Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Gowns, ſuch as they wear when they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at Divine Service. Some People beſides us, that ſaw them fell upon their Knees at the appearance of the two firſt Pieces, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo till the laſt were ſhown, and all were cover'd again. There hung up a large Silver Lamp before the High Altar, by four times 3 good big Silver Chains, and they very long ones too. The Piece of Painting over the Altar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the pretended Aſſumption of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Over the Altar, and over thoſe things foremention'd at the bottom of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture ſtood four Farge and tall Silver Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, with long Tapers of Yellow Wax in them. In the middle of theſe upon a large Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal, which ſeem'd to be Silver, ſtood a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tall Croſs which appear'd to be Silver gilt, the Body upon it was Silver. The Quire here is very large. In the middle of it, ſtands a large Tomb all of Braſs. On the Weſt end of the Tomb is the Effigies of a Man, as big as the Life, in a Biſhops habit kneeling upon a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, with his hands joyn'd and lifted up in a praying Poſture, and with his Face towards the Altar. At the other end ſtands a Skeleton to repreſent Death, who is put looking towards him, and in the Poſture of beckening to him, and calling him; between theſe two, and upon the aforeſaid Tomb, lies a Cheſt which is ſomewhat roundiſh both in the upper and lower Parts of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94187:136"/> it, along by this lies a Biſhop's Broſier, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Round the top of the Tomb there is an Inſcription in Latin which ſignifies, That <hi>Erard à Marca</hi> who govern'd this Dioceſs 36 Years, built this Tomb for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, while he was yet alive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He has left behind him the repute of every good Man, and is remembred with great Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eſteem, as a great Benefactor to his Dioceſs He repaird many things in this City, which were fallen to decay: He rebuilt ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Caſtles from the Ground, and the Walls of ſome of the Cities belonging to this Principalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he died much lamented in the Year, 1538.</p>
               <p>We went into the Church of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> which is on the great Market-place at the time of Compline. There hung up about the Church many Coats of Arms painted upon little Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Shields: Under one was written, with a Name, theſe words, <hi>Paſtor hujus Paroechiae;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another, with a Name, <hi>Captain of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi> under another, <hi>Lieutenant of this Pariſh.</hi> There is a great deal of Marble in this Church about the Altar Pieces, and well poliſht, of curious ſorts, and very handſomely built up, and much of the flower'd Work of it was guilt with Gold. The High Altar of the Church was very fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorn'd, we could not conveniently go up near enough to ſee what the Painting over it contain'd. At the top of the Work about it, and near the top of the Church was ſet up a very large Canopy of Scarlet Velvet, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, with a Gold-galoon up on the Seams, and a deep Gold-fringe round at the lower edge of it. In the middle of this was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery of Silver to repreſent a Dove, with Raies of Gold embroider'd all about as darting
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94187:137"/> from it. This was put up for the ſake of <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide;</hi> we ſaw in ſome other Places the like thing upon this Occaſion. The Ornaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altars here were very rich, being of Scarlet, and other colour'd Silks, with many broad Gold-flowers upon them, and ſome of them had a deep Gold-fringe laid acroſs from one end to the other, about a Foot diſtant from the top, according to the uſual manner. At the Eaſt end of the North Iſle, was an Altar which had over it a piece of Painting, that I ſhall take notice of. In the upper part of it, there is ſet their common, abſurd, and impious Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Holy Trinity; towards the middle of the Piece is the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as looking up to the Perſons above, and pointing downwards: Below her is an Angel, looking I think towards her as to receive her Directions, and reaching downwards; under him are a Company of People making grievous Faces, and in the midſt of Flames, the Angel has hold of one, and is hawling him out, and the reſt are holding up their hands towards him, as deſiring to be lifted out likewiſe. A delicate Fiction, fit for Poets or Painters, who, as <hi>Horace</hi> ſays, have a <hi>Poteſtas quidlibet audendi:</hi> but which ought not to be put upon People by the Teachers of Chriſtianity as an Article of Faith. Here they are taught the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Purgatory, and to look upon the Bleſſed Virgin as the chief Mediatrix, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceder for the Souls there. And theſe things they are likely to be taught, for the Gain and Advantage which the Pope and Roman Clergy derive from them, till the Spirit of Truth ſhall prevail in them above the Love of the world.</p>

As we went up to it, we mounted through one Street which is pav'd in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Steps; theſe Steps were about Two or Three Feet broad, and Three or Four Inches high: Thus we climb'd a great way; at length we came to their Houſe. When we left the Street we had ſtill an aſcent of I believe Sixty Stone Steps to mount to the Door of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; theſe Steps were of the common hard blue Stone of this Country, and I believe each of them a Foot in height. We were ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, and eaſily admitted, upon ſaying only that we were Engliſhmen, come out of Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to ſee the Country. After a little wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we were conducted into the Garden, which Mounts ſtill far above the Houſe. It conſiſts of Five Area's, or Plots, one conſiderably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, on the ſide of the Hill. The Area's themſelves lie in a little Deſcent, and from one to another above it we had ſeveral Steps to aſcend. I doubt not but to the uppermoſt Area, from the Door of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, the height muſt be at leaſt an Hundred Feet. Over a Stone Portal, which enter'd the ſecond Area, were the Arms of a Prince and Biſhop of <hi>Liege,</hi> as I judged, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Maximiliano Electori Fundatori.</hi> Other Diſcourſe, as we were going up, made me forget to ask the Jeſuite with us concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this. In one Garden they had ſeveral very ingenious Sun-dails. One he call'd the blind Man's Dial; becauſe a blind Man having once learnt the order of the Numbers at the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94187:138"/> end of the Lines, might by feeling find what time of the Day it is, thus: The Hour Lines, at which the Figures were ſet, were little flat Bars of Iron; and a Glaſs Globe full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſo ſet between it and the Sun, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the burning Point ſucceſſively, according to the Sun's Motion upon theſe Lines; this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Point would be ſenſible to his Finger, and he would thereby know the time of the Day. In a Concave-Dial, which had Vines laid over it to make the Shadow, and the Hour Lines meeting all in one Centre, they had ſet a little Picture of our Saviour, with his Finger at that Centre, and a Motto, as proceeding from him, in theſe Words, <hi>Haec est Hora tua.</hi> At the top of the higheſt Area they have a ſmall flat Bowling-Ally for Exerciſe, and if that be thought too little to exerciſe ones ſelf much in it, we may judge that the getting up to it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies all that Defect. By this is a Building of Two Stories in height, with Three Rooms in it. From the uppermoſt of theſe they have a very fine Proſpect, being now lifted, I think, above any part of the City. We ſaw from hence the Monaſtery of the Carthuſians, on the top of a neighbouring Hill, where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>Boufflers</hi> planted his Mortars to Bombard this City. As we came down we enter'd the Houſe again from the ſecond Area of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. We went through a large Room where they hold their Diſputes; and from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Library, which is a long narrow Room, like a Gallery. It was well fill'd with Books, which look'd as if they were well uſed, and ſtudied: I may ſay of their Library, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeful than fine. Over ſeveral Partitions
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94187:138"/> of Shelves there was written at the top of the Room, <hi>Libri Theologici, Libri Juridici, Libri Medici, Libri Mathematict,</hi> &amp;c. Two Diviſions had a little Lattice over them, and they were lock'd up. Over theſe was this Title, <hi>Libri Prohibiti.</hi> Among theſe, I could obſerve, was <hi>Cornelij Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenij Auguſtinus,</hi> ſome of the Works of the German Reformers, the <hi>Novum Teſtamentum Gallicum,</hi> which I ſuppoſe is that call'd the <hi>Mons</hi> Teſtament. I could not ſee the Name of any Engliſh Divine among theſe; but on the back of one of the Priſoners there was paſted a Paper, on which was written the Word <hi>Sermons,</hi> this was a thin Folio. He ſhow'd us here a large and good Loadſtone; and a String of Ten Beads, with a Croſs, which ſeem'd to be all Amethyſts; this he ſaid was the Dizaine of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, when ſhe died in <hi>England,</hi> which ſhe had been wont to uſe in reciting her Roſary. He had alſo a little Book of Prayers, cover'd with Velvet; it was a Manuſcript, curiouſly written upon Vellum, and had in it ſome very pretty Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature; this, too, he ſaid had been hers. They may well Venerate the Memory of that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Lady, whoſe Zeal for them, by their Conduct of it, betray'd her to her Death. He ſhow'd us a Cylinder Looking-Glaſs, which was to reduce Figures which ſeem ſhapeleſs and confus'd, into Shape and Order. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it being ſet upon Two Board; which he produc'd, it reflected the Scrawls of one into a Picture of our Saviour, as tied to a Pillar to be ſcourg'd, and crown'd with Thorns. The other, when reflected from the Glaſs, appear'd to be a <hi>George</hi> on Horſeback, with the Dragon
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94187:139"/> under him: He ſaid this was St. <hi>George</hi> for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> At one end of the Library is a piece of Jack-work made for that ſort of Machine with which <hi>Archimedes</hi> pretended to remove the whole Earth out of its Place, if he had but another Place where he could fix his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It held I believe an Hundred Pound weight from the Ground, which was drawn about half way up. There were not many Wheels belonging to it, but I believe the Teeth of all, or moſt of them, were ſet ſloping; they were pretty large Wheels, and each of them catch'd in a Worm which was laid round the Axis of the next Wheel. The Winder might be turn'd by a little Child, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t went ſo eaſie, but the effect of the Machine is mighty ſlow. A Pin was ſtuck upon the top of the Cylinder, on which the Weight hung,. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great many turns of the Winder, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, but very little mov'd. We ſaw here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Book of a ſmall Quarto ſize, with I believe about Forty Leaves in it, or more, of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Writing: It was a large black Character, but made very diſtinct and clear. Some of the Characters had about them a great many Lines, and ſome Points. I ſuppoſe each Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſtood for a Word, for they were ſet equally diſtant from one another. They were extreamly various, yet ſome we could obſerve were often repeated. The Lines went from the top to the bottom of the Leaf; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween every Two Lines of Characters there was drawn a ſmall Line of Ink. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was very thin, ſomewhat browniſh, ſoft as Silk. The Characters, though very black, and written on both ſides the Leaf, did not
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94187:139"/> confound one another. He ſaid, that none of their Fellows in this Houſe could underſtand it; I was ſorry that I could not. He did not offer to ſhew us the Chapel, or any other part of the Houſe, and ſo we did not ask for it. They have, he ſaid, in this Houſe, between Three and Fourſcore Students. and all of them Engliſh, except Two or Three who are of that Country. Their preſent Rector, he ſaid, is one Mr. <hi>Culliſon,</hi> a <hi>Lancaſhire</hi>-man, who upon his Profeſſion chang'd his Name into <hi>Parker.</hi> Theſe People are well belov'd in this Place, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Another Gentleman told us, that there are ſome Congregations of Proteſtants, or Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, in this City, who are tolerated here, as the Papiſts are in <hi>Holland.</hi> He told us this as a Reproach to us for our Cruelty to them in <hi>England,</hi> as we are repreſented in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

I inform'd this Gentleman, as I had done others, that this was but a falſe Report, and a malicious Slander; that we have indeed but few of that Religion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but thoſe of them that will live quietly might do ſo; and that there is no new Law in <hi>England</hi> made to baniſh any Perſons, but ſuch as have been in Correſpondence, during the War, with the Enemies of their Country,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94187:140"/> and that this reaches any others, as well as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who have been found thus guilty. With this they ſeem'd to be ſatisfied. I confeſs'd to ſeveral, that there is a Law this Year made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to baniſh thence all the Monks and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars; but the Secular Prieſts of their Religion, I told them, are tolerated there. This no Body found fault with, for indeed all ſenſible People among them look upon thoſe Societies as ſo many Companies of uſeleſs Drones, and a Burden to the reſt of the World.</p>

               <p>WE had found the Paſſage up the <hi>Maeſe</hi> ſo tedious in coming up hither, and knew the River to be ſtill extreamly ſwell'd by more Rain, that we laid aſide the Thoughts of going to <hi>Namur,</hi> and reſolv'd to croſs the Country to <hi>Colen,</hi> and in our way to ſee <hi>Aix la Chapelle.</hi> There are no fixed Carriages here for <hi>Aix,</hi> tho' this was the time of Concourſe to thoſe Baths.

We found, if we would have a Charrette for us two, the loweſt Price muſt be three Pattacoons, which is four Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, four Stivers; but if we had any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, tho' it were but one Perſon more, we might go for a Pattacoon each Perſon; and this was the loweſt Price for each that would be taken, if the Company were more. If the Company does not exceed four Perſons, they will put but one Horſe in the Charrette; if
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94187:140"/> there be ſix, they will put in two; if eight Perſons, three Horſes, and ſo many is the moſt theſe Chariots will hold. Our Foreman or Charioteer had muſter'd together ſix Perſons, and ſo put into the Chariot two good ſtout Horſes.</p>
               <p>We left <hi>Liege</hi> about ſeven a Clock in the Morning, and travel'd the firſt two Hours in a Valley full of Villages and Houſes along the way, on the ſame ſide of the River that <hi>Liege</hi> moſtly ſtands on, that is the Weſt ſide. This Valley was not very broad between the River and the Hills. The Hills were planted with Vineyards, and the Valley had abundance of Hop-grounds and great Orchards in it, and Gardens, and fields, and Paſture-grounds; every thing look'd as if the Soil were very rich and good. About an Hour after we came from <hi>Liege,</hi> we were in with a large ſcattering Village call'd <hi>Herstal.</hi> A Burgher of <hi>Liege,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Herſtal.</note> in our Company, told us that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> our King, is Owner of this Place, and that he has lately given the People leave, upon their Requeſt, to build them a Town-Houſe. This Town lies upon the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> and may conveniently manage ſome Trade. This Place was famous in the Hiſtory of <hi>France,</hi> under the ſecond Race of their Kings.

'Tis certain that Prince pleaſed himſelf ſo much in this Place, that he cauſed a very magnificent Palace to be built
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94187:141"/> here, wherein he made his Abode very often. Many of his Succeſſors enjoy'd it a long time after; as appears by Charters and Grants da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this Place. One in particular is mention'd of <hi>Charles the Simple,</hi> which takes notice that this King was in Poſſeſſion of it. But it was afterward deſtroy'd by the <hi>Normans,</hi> and ſince that, the Place is become but a mean Village, and has no Remainders of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Greatneſs. The Church we ſaw look'd in a good Condition on the out-ſide; it is a loſty and great Building. We paſs'd through the Place without ſtopping, and ſo could ſee nothing but what was in our way.</p>

                  </note> This is a ſmall City belonging to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of <hi>Liege,</hi> with a Wall about it. It ſtands upon the ſide of a Hill, and ſo makes a good ſhow to the Water; but 'tis a very little Place, and has nothing in it remarkable that we could learn. As ſoon almoſt as we were within the Wall, our way was right up the Hill, ſo we could not ſee but one end of it, which look'd well enough. When we were through the other Gate, and gone out again, which was ſoon done, we ſtill mounted a pretty ſteep Hill which runs up far above the Town; we walk'd, to eaſe our Horſes, above an Engliſh Mile aſcending. This Paſſage from hence to <hi>Aix</hi> is all through a hilly Country; we were almoſt continually aſcending or deſcending ſome great Hill; the largeſt Plains were uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the tops of the Hills. All theſe Hills appear'd a very good Mould; that which was plain at the top, we found conſtantly till'd for Grains, and ſaw upon them very good and promiſing Crops of Wheat and Rye; the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was but juſt ſown, and very little of it was come up. The ſteep ſides of theſe Hills were either cover'd with Wood, or elſe were good green Downs for Sheep.</p>
               <p>As we came near to <hi>Aix,</hi> the Hills were cover'd extreamly thick with a white Stone, like a Lime-ſtone, which lay upon a Mould ſomewhat darker than Fullers-Earth, but which ſeem'd ſuch a ſort of Subſtance. Some Grounds were almoſt cover'd with it, and at a diſtance look'd white; yet was all plow'd and ſown.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:94187:142"/> In ſome we ſaw Barly juſt coming up very thick among the Stones. On ſome pieces of Ground next to thoſe that appear'd ſo full of theſe Stones, we ſaw good Crops of Wheat and Rye a coming, which were ſo thick, and cover'd the Ground ſo well, we could not ſee a Stone upon them, tho' we had reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they were of the ſame ſort with their Neighbours. On ſome of theſe Grounds they were laying good heaps of Stable-Dung, and they laid them very thick. We ſtay'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh our ſelves at a little Village call'd <hi>Gulpe,</hi> upon a Brook of the ſame Name, but the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pronounced the Names of both <hi>Gallop.</hi> We were now in the Dutchy of <hi>Limburg,</hi> which cannot be very broad here, ſince we croſſed it in half a Day's Journey, at a very ſlow rate of travelling. This Brook runs here in a ſmall deep Valley, between two ridges of high Hills, and therefore ſwells ſometimes enormouſly with the Rains. It had been a Day or two before unpaſſable, and now was very full.</p>
               <p>About two Hours before we came to <hi>Aix,</hi> the Company ſaid, <hi>Now we enter into the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of</hi> Aix. We had then a Coppice on our Left Hand, which run from us down the ſide of the Hill: This they ſaid was much infeſted with the French Parties in the time of the War. When we enter'd the Territory of <hi>Aix,</hi> we enter'd alſo the Dutchy of <hi>Juliers,</hi> within the Compaſs of which this Territory is contain'd, juſt upon the Frontiers, between <hi>Juliers</hi> and <hi>Limburg</hi> Dutchies. We could not reach <hi>Aix</hi> till between 8 and 9 a Clock, through the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs and heavineſs of the way.</p>

               <p>It is agreed to have been a very ancient City, but the Beginnings of it are ſomewhat <note place="margin">Original,</note> diſputed. <hi>Munſter</hi> will have it to be built by <hi>Granus,</hi> a Brother of <hi>Nero</hi> the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; but it is not found that <hi>Nero</hi> had ever a Brother of that Name. Some think that <hi>Seren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Granus</hi> built it in the time of the Emperor <hi>Adrian.</hi> 'Tis certain that the Romans, while they made War upon the Germans, had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Settlements and Fortifications in theſe Countries, between the <hi>Maeſe</hi> and the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and thoſe were in many Places, the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of what grew to be Cities in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Times. The Romans make mention of theſe Baths, and always call'd the Place <hi>Aquiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granum,</hi> or <hi>Aquae Grani.</hi> The Low Dutch call the City <hi>Aken,</hi> the Germans <hi>Aach,</hi> and the French <hi>Aix,</hi> contracted from <hi>Eaux,</hi> which in their Language ſignifies Waters. They have added the Words <hi>la Chapelle,</hi> by reaſon of the Famous Chapel built there by <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> and to diſtinguiſh it from an <hi>Aix</hi> in their own Country, which is the head City of <hi>Provence.</hi> There alſo are hot Baths, which, becauſe the City about them was built by <hi>Sextus,</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Conſul, the Latines have been wont to call them <hi>Aquae Sextiae.</hi> This <hi>Aix</hi> which we are now ſpeaking of, muſt without doubt have been a conſiderable City in their Times. It was utterly ruin'd by the Goths and Huns, when they broke in upon the Empire, under the Leading of <hi>Attila,</hi> that prodigious Man of Miſchief, ſome time after the Year of our
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94187:143"/> Lord 400; and after this, theſe Baths were neglected and forgotten. It came to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd again, they ſay, after this manner: The Emperor <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> as he was hunting here, obſerv'd that his Horſes Hoofs ſpirted up ſome Water which ſmoak'd; upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the matter, he found that there were hot Springs here. He conſider'd, and was mightily pleas'd with the Situation of the Place, which indeed is very pleaſant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; and thereupon built himſelf here firſt a Palace, and ſoon after the Chappel, which is ſtill ſtanding, tho' the Palace is down. He being thus ſetled here, and ſpending common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Winters in this Place, when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd from his Wars, this occaſion'd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of People, and many ſorts of Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men built Houſes and ſettled here; and thus it grew again into a City in his Time. This is the City which is included within the inner Wall, (for there are two here alſo) which is ſtill remaining, and has in it ten Gates which are the Paſſages through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> We were ſhew'd within this an old Stone Wall encompaſſing a little ſpot of Ground, which look'd indeed by the Window-holes like a Church Wall, and were told that this had been the firſt Church of this City. If this were ſo, there muſt have been Chriſtianity planted and profeſs'd here in the Times of the Romans, and before it was ruin'd by the Goths and Huns. This inner City, call'd, from <hi>Charlemaigne, St. Charles his City,</hi> (for the Papiſts have canoniz'd him) was utterly deſtroy'd again by the barbarous Normans, about the Year of our Lord 882, under the Leading of <hi>Godfride</hi> and <hi>Sigefride:</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:94187:143"/> They ruin'd the ſtately Palace of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which there are now no Remains of. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year 1172, by the Command of the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the Firſt, it was inveſted with the ſecond and outermoſt Wall. After ſeveral Conflagrations that it has ſuffer'd, there hapned the moſt terrible one of all in the Year 1656, which they ſay burnt down Four thouſand Houſes. It burnt down almoſt all the inner City, and the greateſt part of the outer. But this Miſchief is now perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, the Water, they ſay, repairing the Harms of the Fire; and indeed they have ſuch Plenty of Water in this City, that with good and orderly Management they might eaſily prevent its receiving much Harm by Fire. There are many plentiful Springs of freſh and very good Water in the Town, beſides thoſe which are hot and medicinal; they feed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Publick Fountains which continually run waſt. The Water runs from ſome of them at ten or twelve feet high from the Ground, from thence it falls into a great Stone Trough or Ciſtern, and from thence is receiv'd for uſe by the Citizens.

               <p>
                  <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> made this City the Seat of his Empire on this ſide the <hi>Alps;</hi> and by an old Cuſtom, the Emperors of <hi>Germany</hi> have been wont to be crown'd here. It continued down
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94187:144"/> to the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who was crowned King of the Romans in this City, in the Year 1531, and was afterwards Emperor, upon the Reſignation of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth. But this Cuſtom has been of late relinquiſh'd, and the preſent Emperor was crown'd at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> the Place where, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Rule, the Emperours are elected. <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> ſpent good part of his Life here, and at laſt died in this City, in the Year of our Lord 814, and was buried in the Church which he built, after he had liv'd 72 Years, and reigned 47. After his Times, in the Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Sanction, this is call'd a Royal City, and Imperial, and Head of all the Provinces and Cities of the Teutonick or German Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. 'Tis ſo call'd again in the time of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> the Second, by ſome Charter of his, dated <hi>January</hi> 1166. It has been a free City, and govern'd by Magiſtrates and a Senate within themſelves. When it was deſerted and neglected by the Emperors, it was glad of the Favour and Countenance of its neareſt and ſtrongeſt Neighbours, and ſome time it was under the Protection of the Duke of <hi>Juliers,</hi> afterwards it came to own the Duke of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> for its Protector. It was taken by the Marquis <hi>Spinola,</hi> in the Year 1614, and from that time, it ſeems to have been in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſubject to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> For, as we were told, he receives a Revenue from this City, and its Territory, yearly; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been pawn'd to the States General, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with many others, for Money lent du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the War, they were ſaid to raiſe here upon that ſcore about 90000 Florins <hi>per An.</hi>

               <p>This City is ſituate in a Valley, but at one ſide of it, ſo that part of the City runs up a good way on the ſide of a neighbouring Hill. From the Wall on that ſide, one has a wide and pleaſant Proſpect all over the City, and a large neighbouring Valley, to the Hills which bound that and our ſight. It looks very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, by virtue of the Mixture of Trees with the Houſes, and of Orchards and Gardens, eſpecially towards the out-ſide of the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt City. There are within the City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the hot Mineral Waters, ſome cold Springs of Medicinal Water; but theſe are now of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no uſe, eſpecially ſince the drinking of the warm Water is come in Faſhion. The Streets are generally broad and airy. The great Market-Place is very large, bigger than what we had ſeen in ſome bigger Cities: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſtands the Town-Houſe, a ſtately handſome Building, and which looks great enough to become ſo Famous a City. 'Tis built of Stone, and is obſervable at a diſtance by two high Towers which ſtand up at the two ends of the Front. The Citizens built this Houſe at their own Charge, about the Year 1353. In the middle of the Great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, before it, ſtands a Noble Fountain, which was erected in the Year 1620. From a height of 14 or 15 feet, or perhaps more, there are 4 good Spouts of Water which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually run into a great braſs Baſon, of 10 feet in Diameter, and about 30 in Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; it is ſaid to contain in it 12000 Pounds of Braſs. From this Baſon the Water deſcends again by ſix Channels into a large Stone Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle, from whence it is convey'd in Pipes,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94187:145"/> under Ground, to the Houſes of particular Citizens. The whole Fountain is encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd by a tall, ſtrong, iron Rail. At the top of the Fountain ſtands an Effigies of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaigne,</hi> bigger than the Life, in Braſs: He is arm'd <hi>Cap-a-pe,</hi> has an Imperial Crown on his Head, a Scepter in his Right Hand, and a Globe in his Left; his Face is ſet Eaſtward, as looking towards <hi>Germany.</hi> About the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal which he ſtands on, is this Inſcription, in Latin, <hi>S. Carolus Magnus, Patronus &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaurator hujus Urbis.</hi> He, it ſeems, is reputed by the Papiſts the Patron or Protectour of this City.</p>
               <p>The Hills within the adjoining Territory of this City, are plentifully ſtor'd with Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Towards the Eaſtern Bounds, which border upon the Dutchy of <hi>Juliers,</hi> and the <note place="margin">Braſs.</note> Abbacy of <hi>Cornelis Munſter,</hi> they dig a good quantity of <hi>Lapis Calaminaris.</hi> With this they make Braſs in this City.

The Dutch and Germans do not diſtinguiſh theſe Metals, as we do, by the Names of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Braſs, but call both Copper, the one Red and the other Yellow Copper. They dig from their Hills ſome Iron, and an Ore that yields Brimſtone and Vitriol; and they have very rich Mines of Lead, beſides Plenty of Coal and Wood alſo for Fuel, and Stone for Building.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:94187:145"/>
               <p>In this City is one of the chief Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of Needles perhaps in the World, tho' <note place="margin">Needles.</note> the Wyre which they make them of is not made here, but comes from ſome other Parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> We went to ſee ſome of the Work about the making of theſe. They ſay they paſs from firſt to laſt through 60 hands; I believe they muſt reckon from the taking of the Iron out of the Ground to the ſewer with the Needle, to make up that Number, and account to every Perſon, as they ſhould do, two Hands. They have a vaſt Machine which is mov'd with a Water-mill, in which they brighten and ſmooth them, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ruſty, by many Millions at a time, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſeveral Works about them. We did not ſee it going, but could eaſily ſee how the thing is done. They are rubb'd and turn'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two flat Boards of about three or four feet ſquare: The Mill moves the upper Board backward and forward a little way upon the lower one; and there were, I believe, a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of theſe pairs of Boards in one Room, all which the Mill could ſet to work at once.</p>
               <p>In this City, beſides the Chapel of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi> were Four Pariſh Churches, one of <note place="margin">Churches.</note> which, the Church of St. <hi>John,</hi> lies at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Ruines. There are a great Number of the Churches of the Religious Orders, as they are call'd. In one of the Parochial Churches, which they call St. <hi>James's,</hi> there was held on this Day, being the 25th. of <hi>May,</hi> New Stile, a <hi>Kermis.</hi> As we went to it we moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:94187:146"/> with Greens, and they were mingled ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with ſuch Flowers as could be gotten. When we came to the Church, we found it but ſmall, but made very fine on this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We were there at the time of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; the Church was very full, and we ſtood in a Crowd, but ſtaid a good while very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to hear the Muſick, which was made by a mixture of Organs and Voices, both very good, and perfectly harmonious and agreeing. We did not ſee any Image ſtanding upon a Carriage in the Church, as is uſual when they are carried in Proceſſion, therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though there had been a Proceſſion about the Pariſh, they had carried only the Hoſtie. When we went from the Church, our way was down a broad Street, which for a good way was beſet, as aforeſaid, with tall Boughs, that look'd like little Trees, and was ſtrow'd with Greens. Beſides this, they had, to adorn the Street, tied ſeveral Ropes croſs the way, at the ſecond Stories of the Houſes, and theſe were all cover'd, and hid with green Leaves which they had faſten'd about them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we ſhould ſee Two of theſe Ropes ſo order'd, that they croſs'd one another in the middle of the Street, and where they croſs'd there hung a Crown, made of ſome ſlight matter, but glittering like Gold. Upon Ropes ſo tied acroſs the Streets we ſaw here, and ſomewhere elſe in our Journey, ſome Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threads hanging down from them, of about Five or Six Feet long; theſe would have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other at the ends of them to make a ſhow, and they had faſten'd to them, I know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:94187:146"/> mixed with green Leaves; theſe, as the Wind mov'd them, and the Sun ſhone upon them, made a very pretty ſurprizing gliſtering. This that I have mentioned is all that belong'd to the <hi>Kermis</hi> here, and no other part of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, beſides this Pariſh, was concern'd with it. I remember, at <hi>Louvain</hi> there was a particular <hi>Kermis</hi> held, as I think, by the <hi>Augustine</hi> Monks, which conſiſted in nothing more but what has been ſaid: And, I think, at <hi>Leeuwe</hi> it was a <hi>Kermis</hi>-time with them, when we paſs'd through there, where alſo there was nothing to be obſerv'd, but a Concourſe of People to an annual particular Devotion. Theſe things oblige me to take notice of the Original and true Nature of a <hi>Kermis.</hi> This Word is a Contraction of <hi>Kerk-miſſe,</hi> which ſignifies a Church Maſs, or a Maſs celebrated to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate and give Thanks for the furniſhing and Conſecration of a Church. To theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities there was wont to be a Concourſe of People, to ſee perhaps the ſhow of a Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and ſometimes they might be allur'd by ſome Indulgencies to be obtain'd in that Church at ſuch a time. This Concourſe of People upon a religious account, invited others to come with Goods of ſeveral Sorts, to ſell them upon theſe Occaſions; and thus a <hi>Kerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe</hi> came to be accompany'd with what we call a Fair. And among the Calviniſts of theſe Parts, with the Popery of the thing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is baniſh'd too, and the <hi>Kerk-miſſe</hi> is throughly reform'd, according to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in ſeveral things, into a meer trading and debauching Fair; eſpecially in ſome Parts, where Trade is reckon'd a thing of more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94187:147"/> than Religion; where they retain ſtill the Name of <hi>Kermis,</hi> but have loſt the true thing, though they obſerve their Fairs too at the ſame times.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Trinity Sunday</hi> now with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo in the Morning there were Sermons in the Chapels of the religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: In going about to ſee what was to be ſeen, we fell into ſome of theſe. We obſerv'd them to be generally very neat, and ſome of them fine with the Architecture, and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and Ornaments about the Altars. In the <hi>Auguſtines</hi> was a great butcherly Fellow in the Pulpit, putting himſelf into a Sweat with talking to the People in High Dutch, which is the vulgar Language here. His Church was a pretty large one indeed, but bigger than his Congregation a great deal. In the Church of the <hi>Minor Brothers</hi> was one of that Order preaching, who look'd more like a Scholar; and his Church, though as big as the former, was hardly big enough for his Congregation.</p>
               <p>In the Evening our Courſe brought us to the Church of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> of that Species of them who are call'd the <hi>Brothers of our Good</hi>

               <p>The Scapulary is a Name deriv'd, they ſay, from the Latin Word <hi>Scapulare,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Shoulder-cloathing.

               <p>The uſe of this thing, they ſay, is very old in the Order of <hi>our Good Lady of Mount Carmel,</hi> (as they call themſelves:) Even from the time of <hi>Elias</hi> it has been uſed, who firſt wore it himſelf, and after his Example his Diſciples and Followers have done the ſame. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil has always greatly fear'd this Garment; but the Power of it has been very much encreas'd ſince it has been conſecrated by our Good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and made a Token of a Covenant between her, and thoſe who ſhall devoutly wear it. How the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> came to Honour it thus, they give this Account.</p>
               <p>When this Good Order were driven out of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> by the Turks, and forced to fly into ſeveral Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and were there in great Diſtreſs, not being very well entertain'd where they came, they betook themſelves for Refuge to God, and the Holy Maid <hi>Mary,</hi> their particular Patroneſs. And the Holy <hi>Simon Stock</hi> being then Prior-General of the Order, he took the matter to Heart more than any Body beſides, praying this Gracious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with great Humility and Zeal to come to their Aſſiſtance; and that through her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſome Privilege and Advantage to their Order might be obtain'd, the which was now ſo low and oppreſs'd. And very often to pleaſe her he read the Hymn <hi>Flos Carmeli, &amp;c.</hi> to her Honour. The Holy Maid, and Mother of Mercy, liſtening to the Prayers of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94187:148"/> appear'd to this Saint, attended with a multitude of Angels, in a mighty Glory; and gave him the Scapulary as a Token of her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friendſhip, and her Protection and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Order, and of all thoſe who ſhall devoutly wear the ſame, ſaying to him (theſe remarkable Words.)

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are very high Recommendations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of this matter, and cannot chuſe but be mightily regarded, when theſe People ſay that the Bleſſed <hi>Simon Stock</hi> ſaid, that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf ſaid ſuch things of it when ſhe deliver'd it to him.</p>
               <p>To advance this Habit, they extravagantly advance the Bleſſed Virgin, and tell us that ſhe is exalted in Merit and Glory, and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, above all Mankind, and above all the Quires of Angels: (I know not whence they learn this) So that ſhe is to be ſerv'd with an Honour and Veneration beyond all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nam'd <hi>Hyperdulia:</hi> And ſhe is honour'd by the Holy Church, (they mean the Church of <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Inſomuch, that among the apparent Tokens that a Man is choſen to Everlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, this is to be reckon'd a conſiderable one; namely a ſincere Honour, active Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Love to <hi>Mary;</hi> and ſo the matter is well mended.</p>
               <p>There are many mighty Privileges attend the devout wearing of this Scapulary, if we may believe theſe People. As firſt, a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Aſſiſtance they ſhall have from it towards a happy Death: An Aſſiſtance towards Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of Purgatory; eſpecially on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Saturday</hi> after their Death, the which Day they ſay is particularly devoted to her. This ſhe her ſelf made known to Pope <hi>John</hi> II. who ſays ſhe appear'd to him dreſs'd like one of this Order, and among other things (as wiſe) ſhe ſaid, that ſhe would ſtand by every Perſon who ſhould devoutly wear this Holy Garment, and enter themſelves in this Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood; that they ſhould be abſolv'd from the third Part of their Sins upon the Day of their Entrance; and that on every <hi>Saturday</hi> ſhe would deſcend into Purgatory, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this Brotherhood as ſhe ſhould find there, ſhe would deliver, and bring them to the Mount of Everlaſting Life. But they muſt, to merit this, read at appointed times ſuch and ſuch Prayers to the Virgin; and thoſe who cannot read, muſt, inſtead of it,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94187:149"/> faſt and abſtain from Fleſh on <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays,</hi> excepting when the Birth-day of her Son falls upon either of theſe days. Another Privilege is Protection in Danger, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Help againſt the Devil and Witchcraft; And on this Occaſion a multitude of ſwinging Stories of Miraculous Deliverances are told.</p>
               <p>Among the Privileges attending the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulary, muſt be reckon'd the Indulgences gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Brotherhood, and alſo to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who ſhall upon ſuch and ſuch days Viſit the Chapels of this Order, and theſe are many. There are near Forty Holy-days in a Year diſperſed through the ſeveral Months, which the Brothers and Siſters of the Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary are to Celebrate in the Churches of theſe <hi>Carms,</hi> and on which they are to enjoy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Indulgences; And this 'tis ſaid they are to do to the greater Glory of God, and our good Lady; (But indeed they are to do it to help to maintain theſe lazy Fellows by their Alms, as their Offerings are call'd.) It is likewiſe to be reckon'd a mighty Privilege of this Brotherhood, that every Brother and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhall partake in all the Merits of this Bleſſed Order. This is the common Wheedle to draw Men into theſe Brotherhoods.</p>
               <p>In order to their obtaining theſe Privileges, theſe three things are requir'd: (1.) That the Holy Scapulary be receiv'd from ſome Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of the Order who has Authority to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe it. (2.) That the Perſon's Name who receives it, be written in the Book of the Brotherhood. (3.) That he do wear this Scapulary Night and Day, not in his Pocket, nor as a Girdle about his Waſt, but about his
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94187:150"/> Neck. This is the outward and bodily wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Garment; but beſides this, there is a ſpiritual wearing of it alſo requir'd: For as the Body has Life through the Soul, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the outward wearing of the Scapulary muſt become vital and profitable to the Soul, through the pious and devout wearing of the ſame; namely, with the ſame Regard and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Mind to this (or greater) with that which Men or Maid-Servants bear to the Livery of their Maſter or Lady. To which end, the Brothers and Siſters ſhall very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably obſerve theſe Five Exerciſes following: (1.) When they riſe in the Morning, as alſo when at Night they go to ſleep, they ſhall kiſs the Scapulary, and making a Croſs with it, ſhall bleſs themſelves, ſaying, <hi>May the Holy Maid</hi> Mary, <hi>and her ſweet little Child,</hi> (ſo they repreſent our Saviour, for the moſt part, ſtill) <hi>bleſs us.</hi> Or at leaſt they ſhould, looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scapulary, offer up to God the Works of the Day under the Guidance and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Holy Patroneſs. (2.) In all Occaſions of Danger, both of Soul and Body; and in all Temptations, they muſt in Heart turn themſelves to the moſt H. Mother of God, imploring her Aſſiſtance. (3.) They muſt endeavour to avoid all that is contrary to Modeſty, as very diſpleaſing to the Queen of Virgins, and Mother of the King of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. (4.) Often in the Day, as they begin any Work, they ſhould Offer it up to God, and recommend it to the moſt Holy Maid, as a good Governeſs; and muſt perform, and bring it to Perfection to her Honour. (5.) They muſt be careful to merit and obtain the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94187:150"/> granted to the Brotherhood of this Holy Garment, (that eſpecially was not to be omitted, becauſe for theſe they muſt go to the Churches of theſe good Fathers, and there drop their Offerings.)</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude the Account of this matter with certain Elogiums of the Scapulary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd by a Zealous <hi>Carm,</hi> in a Sermon preach'd within the Dioceſs of <hi>Arras,</hi> on the <hi>21st.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1697. The 20th. day of this Month is with them the Feaſt-day of their Holy Father, as they call him, the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> who firſt wore this Garment, and inſtituted this Order; and ſo this was within the <hi>Octave</hi> of that Feſtival. The Propoſitions are theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Bleſſed <hi>Simon Stock</hi> has receiv'd the Scapulary, as a certain mark of his Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and of that of the Religious of his Order, and of thoſe others too, who in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time ſhall receive and wear it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Hiſtory of the Bleſſed <hi>Simon Stock</hi> is in a degree of certainty which approaches that of the Faith; and it cannot be doubted of without being guilty of a ſort of Infidelity, into which all wiſe and pious People ought to be afraid of falling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Among all the Practices of Devotion found out to Honour the Holy Virgin, that of the Scapulary is the moſt certain mark of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, and the moſt aſſured ſign of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Children and Brothers of the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulary ought to ſay to the Holy Virgin, <hi>Be it unto me according to thy Word,</hi> with the ſame Submiſſion to her, which ſhe her ſelf paid to to the Promiſes of God, which were made to her by the Angel.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:94187:151"/>5. If the Holy Virgin ſhould permit that the Children and Brothers of the Scapulary ſhould be Eternally Miſerable, their Loſs would afford Triumphs to the Enemies of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her Name, and would furniſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for their Blaſphemies.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Church has been willing that the Believers ſhould underſtand that they are to expect no leſs Favours from the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, than from the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A Brother of the Scapulary, who ſhall obſtinately ſet himſelf to go on in Wickedneſs to his Death, may die in Impenitence, but he cannot die in the Scapulary: And if the Holy Virgin cannot withdraw him from his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and Sins, ſhe will find means to deprive him of his Scapulary, and will rather take it from him her ſelf, than ſuffer that he ſhould die a Reprobate in it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are very pretty things! and but what is commonly ſaid in Commendation of the Scapulary by theſe Fathers, whoſe Intereſt it is to recommend it. But theſe things how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeem'd at leaſt to diſpleaſe the Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi> and he has taken upon him the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Cenſure and Condemn them: But his Condemnation looks a little forc'd, and hardly in earneſt, while he ſpeaks of the ſame Matters very near with the ſame Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</p>
               <p>He ſays, We cannot too much exhort the People to Devotion to the Holy Virgin: That this is a great Source of Bleſſings and Graces for thoſe who have a true and ſincere one: He ſays too, that the Brotherhood of the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulary ought to be regarded as a Chriſtian
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:94187:151"/> Bond, and a Holy Aſſociation of ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to Honour the Holy Virgin, by wearing a certain Habit, by which they teſtifie their willingneſs to Dedicate and Conſecrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to her Service. And if this be done in Truth and Fidelity, one may expect by the Succour and Aſſiſtance of the Mother of Mercy, not only particular Favours during this Life, and at Death; but alſo that the Pains which our Sins have deſerv'd, ſhall be diminiſh'd, and our Eternal Happineſs be advanced by the Merit of the Indulgences which the Church has granted to this Brotherhood, for all thoſe to partake of them who ſhall be found in the Condition which ſhe requires for the gaining them.</p>
               <p>It behov'd the Biſhop to ſpeak thus tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But, Lord, how long!</p>
               <p>This time, when we were at the Chapel of theſe <hi>Carms</hi> at <hi>Aix,</hi> being the Eve of that great Day wherein they pretend the Scapulary was given to <hi>Simon Stock,</hi> the Devotions upon the Occaſion were according to Cuſtome then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. A great Concourſe of People throng'd the little Church. We came there juſt at the beginning of a Proceſſion. It march'd down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he South Iſle of the Church; and, croſſing
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94187:152"/> the Weſt end, went out at the bottom, at a North Door, and then turn'd round in a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that went round the Church, and came into the great Street at the Weſt end again; fetch'd a little compaſs in that, and went to the oppoſite ſide of it, and from thence croſs'd again, and came in at the great Weſtern Door. A Company of Queaſils led the Van of this Proceſſion, all of them with their Veils over their Heads, tho' the Weather was good, and it was not for fear of Rain, but out of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Virgin. In the head of them, Four of their Company carry'd upon their Shoulders a little Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> very richly cloath'd with a Robe of Cloth of Silver, and a Crown on her Head. The Crown was Silver, and her Robe flouriſh'd over with an Embroidery of Gold. The Queaſils ſung as they went along; they were follow'd by a great Company of other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who went Two and Two in great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. After theſe march'd about Forty of the <hi>Carmes</hi> in their Habits, and they were all ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too. Then about a Dozen of them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, with Surplices and Copes upon them; theſe were immediately follow'd by the Hoſt, which was carried in a gilt Remonſtranter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Canopy of Silk, by a <hi>Carme,</hi> in a very rich Cope of Cloth of Silver, with Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery about it. After him came a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Men in Diſorder. There were no Flambeaux's this time, nor any Men, but the Monks that march'd before the Hoſt. We had not ſo much Devotion to the Scapulary, as to Honour it in following the Proceſſion; and therefore, while they were going their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94187:152"/> we viewed the Church, which was well dreſs'd, ſmelt very ſtrong of Incenſe, and had a great many Wax-Tapors lighted, and ſet in Siver Candleſticks, about the High Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; the piece of Painting over that, was the Repreſentation of the feign'd Aſſumption of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> There was nothing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to be obſerv'd here. We came to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi> Church after this, which is handſome and large; there were very few People at this Church now. The Monks were ſigning their Devotions in a Place behind the High Altar, where they were not to be ſeen. A Rail at the Eaſt end of the North Iſle, enclos'd a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which I ſuppoſe is dedicated to St. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broerd;</hi>

                     <hi>St.</hi> Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broerd.</note> becauſe on the Wall, at the ſide of the Chapel, was a Picture of a Biſhop at full length, and under it this Inſcription in Latin; <hi>Caput ſancti Willibrordi miraculis &amp; hominum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitatione Celebre.</hi> It ſeems, they pretend to have the Head of St. <hi>Willibroerd.</hi> It did not appear, and therefore is ſhown but at certain times, perhaps only on a particular Holy-day, and with a ſolemn Maſs, and ſo it makes a gaudy Day to the Monks of this Convent. He was, 'tis ſaid, the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> and the great Inſtrument of converting the Heathen Franks there, who poſſeſs'd the Country at that time, having driven out the Romans. Our Hiſtorian, <hi>Bede,</hi> ſays of him, he was an <hi>Anglo-Saxon,</hi> and died in the Year of our Lord 636. He is a Saint of great Repute in all theſe Countries; and one ſhall frequently meet with at leaſt an Altar and Chapel dedicated to him. At a Village near <hi>Antwerp,</hi> there is a Church which goes by his Name, as dedicated to him, which is there the Pariſh Church.</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:94187:153"/>
               <p>The Jeſuites have at <hi>Aix</hi> a very large and <note place="margin">Jeſuites.</note> commodious Houſe, and they are making it larger. We went firſt into their Chapel. Over the Door of this, on the out-ſide, in Letters of Gold, is written <hi>Sancte Michael, Sancte Joſeph, Orate pro nobis.</hi> By an Inſcription on the inſide, over the Portal of another Door, is ſignified, that this Chapel was conſecrated in the Year of our Lord, 1628. by <hi>Petrus Aloyſius Caraffa Epiſcopus Inicarenſis,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Saint Michael, and all Angels.</hi> The Form of this Chapel, the ſame with that of all the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites Chapels that I have ſeen, is Oblong, with Galleries over the two ſide Iſles, which run the whole length of the Iſles, and are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Pillars which ſtand up on each ſide the middle Iſle, to the top of the Church, and ſupport the Roof of it. This Faſhion is very convenient, and looks very magnificent and handſome. The Organ and Muſick have a Gallery which goes acroſs the Weſt end of the Chapel. The Eaſt end, wherein the High Altar ſtands, is a large Semi-circle, the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter the whole breadth of the middle Iſle, and without a Rail, or any Partition before it. The Wall round this, at the bottom of the great Windows, is curiouſly carv'd for about the depth of Six Feet, in the Repreſentation of Vines and Flowers. The matter is Stone, I cannot tell whether Marble or not, for it was all richly gilded with Gold. The Altar Piece repreſents the laying our Saviour, as dead, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Sepulchre, the Figures, and the Faces concern'd, are extreamly well drawn. This Piece is ſurrounded by a very beautiful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture of Marble, a great deal of which,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94187:153"/> in convenient Places, is gilded. There are Two Chapels at the Two Sides of this Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle, to which one enters by little Doors, and they are perfectly enclos'd. They are extreamly neat and fine, both of them; that on the North ſide is dedicated to ſome one of the pretended Saints of their Order, I think it to be <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> their Founder. In the other is an Altar-piece, which I think wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is painted an old Man with a Triple Crown on his Head, in the Clouds, but as come down to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, almoſt, of the Piece, and with Angels about him. He with his Arms ſpread, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf to a Woman, in a manner of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, who is ſitting a little below with a Child in her Lap. Another Man ſits at her Right Hand; they both look very pleaſantly on the old Man; neither of them are in a Poſture of Adoration. Over the Head of the Woman, and pretty near her, is a Pigeon, in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of flying towards her, with a green Garland in its Bill, which he directs, as deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to drop it upon her Head. Now, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a very diſtinct, and impious Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too, one would think this Buſineſs deſign'd to repreſent an old Man, ſome Pope or other, deſigning to borrow of another Man, with his conſent, the uſe of his Wife; and in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I doubt not but this is the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and ſafe Interpretation of this Picture; I muſt confeſs, the ſight of it would make a Man fall to his Prayers; but my Prayer upon this Occaſion would be this, <hi>Good Lord, bring into the Way of Truth all ſuch as have erred and</hi>

               </p>
               <p>After this we went to ſee the Houſe, which was ſhown us very particularly, we having with us a Friend of theirs. We went up Two Stories, in each of which is a long Gallery, with lodging Rooms all on one ſide of it. At one end of the firſt Gallery ſtood a Concave Steel, poliſh'd, and of about Twelve or Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Inches Diameter; before this a Lamp is ſet, which when 'tis lighted, this Concave Steel, by Reflection, ſo encreaſes the Light, that it reaches, to good purpoſe, to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the Gallery, though it be a very long one. In this lower Gallery, between the Doors of the Chambers, are hung up ſome ſorry little Pictures, in Frames, the moſt of them repreſenting the pretended Saints and Martyrs of their Order. Among others, there is the Picture of a Man, to the Waſte, with a remarkably broad Butcher's Knife drawn, as ſtuck into the middle of his Breaſt; this made us take notice of, and read the Inſcription at the bottom of the Picture. The Inſcription ſignifies, that this is <hi>Thomas Harcourt,</hi> who was put to Death at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for the true Faith. Thus they make a Martyr of a Man, who was executed after a fair and legal Tryal, and Conviction of High-Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Sovereign. In the Gallery above this, in the ſecond Story, there were Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions over ſeveral Doors, which fignified them Chambers deſign'd for Strangers; that is, for the Reception of thoſe of their Order who
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:94187:154"/> come to the Baths here. Over other Doors there were theſe Inſcriptions, <hi>Magiſter Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Magister Syntaxeos, Magiſter Mediae Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matices, Magiſter Infimae Grammatices.</hi> For they have belonging to this Houſe a great Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein are ſeveral Schools for Grammar and Philoſophy, in which they teach, they ſay, I think, about Eight hundred Scholars of all ſorts together. We went into one of the Chambers for Strangers, and found there a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bed, a Table, a Chair, and a Candleſtick: I took notice that this anſwer'd the Furniture of the Prophet's Chamber, mention'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the Jeſuite pointed to ſomewhat more here, which I did not before ſee, that was a ſlooping Shelf, with a Breviary upon it, and below a little Plank to kneel upon; here the Jeſuite was to pay his Devotions to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> At the end of this Gallery is their Library, which is no great Room, and yet not near fill'd with Books; and they are alſo old, and in a bad Condition, ſo that this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neglected. They have built a large Addition to their College, which has Two Stories in it, with Two long Galleries, and Chambers in them like the other, but this was not quite finiſh'd. In the firſt Story of this he ſhow'd us a good capacious Room, which they deſign for a Library, ſo that they will now apply themſelves to the Improvement of that. In one long Room of the Houſe were a great many little Appartiments, like the common Boxes in the <hi>London</hi> Ale-Houſes; and at the end of the Room is a great Stove. This Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance is to keep them warm at their Studies in Winter, for all things are commonly order'd
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94187:155"/> with great Conveniency for thoſe good Men, who renounce the World, and pretend to great Mortifications.</p>
               <p>Let us now go to the great Church, built by <hi>Charlemaigne.</hi> He erected this at his own <note place="margin">Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne's <hi>Chapel.</hi>
                  </note> Charge, and brought hither Pope <hi>Leo</hi> III. and Three hundred ſixty three Biſhops to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of it, in the Year 804. It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to our Saviour, and the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; but our Saviour's Intereſt in that, as well as in the Worſhip there perform'd, is well nigh juſtled out, and the Name it is call'd by now, is <hi>De Urouwen Kerk,</hi> that is as much as <hi>Notredame,</hi> or <hi>Our Ladies Church.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſettl'd here, when he firſt built it, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of <hi>Benedictines,</hi> who were to live in common, under the Direction of an Abbot: But theſe at length transform'd themſelves into Canons Seculars, and divided the Revenue among them, appropriating to each Man his Share, and in this State they are at preſent. That which was properly <hi>Charlemaigne</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is a round Building, and very dark. As ſoon as one is enter'd, a Man finds himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a broad dark Iſle, if I may ſo call it, which goes round the Church; the arched Roof of this, is ſupported by very vaſt Stone Pillars. Over this Iſle there is a Gallery, which goes round the Church alſo; I ſaw no way open that led to it, and therefore we did not go up. This is ſurrounded on the outſide with Marble Pillars, which ſupport the Roof of that, and the arched top of the Church which riſes in the Form of a <hi>Cupolo.</hi> There is a Painting on the Arch of the <hi>Cupolo,</hi> which has been fine, but has now not only loſt its
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94187:155"/> Beauty, but is ſo decay'd, one cannot well tell what to make of it. Time and hard U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage have defaced the Beauty of this Church extreamly, and depriv'd it of Finery and Riches, which it was formerly poſſeſs'd of. On the Eaſt ſide of the ancient, and firſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is now a magnificent and large Quire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as big as the other; this is very light, with great Windows, made after the later Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. This was built at the Charge of the City, long after the other, about the Year 1353. 'Tis ſaid to be Fifty Feet in length within, and of a proportionable breadth. In the middle of this ſtands a large Tomb of black poliſh'd Marble, very plain, in which lies bury'd the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> III. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> as he died in this City, ſo he was bury'd in the Chapel which he built here. His Monument at firſt was no way fine, and had no other Inſcription on it but this, which was ſet on by his own Order,
<q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caroli Magni, Chriſtianiſſimi, Romano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Imperatoris,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There was nothing of this ſhown us, and therefore I ſuppoſe it does not remain. 'Tis ſaid the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> I. took his Body out of his Tomb, and put part of it in a Silver Cheſt, over the Altar of the Quire, and a part of it on the right ſide of the Church, againſt the Wall of the old Building, where he built a curious Monument of Marble about it. This does not appear; and the Silver Cheſt is gone too, I doubt not, for they told us nothing of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:94187:156"/> it, and the Havocks which have been made here by barbarous Nations, would leave no ſuch things.</p>
               <p>The chief Altar of this Church, is dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſtands on the Eaſt ſide the Church, between that and the Quire. It was now dreſs'd up, I believe, in its beſt manner, this being a Feſtival-time, but was not very fine. There ſtood an Image of the Virgin over it, about as big as a Child of Two Years old, with a rich Robe of Cloth of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon her, and a Crown and Scepter, which alſo ſeem'd to be Silver. The Entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the Quire are on each ſide of this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. I obſerv'd over this Altar, but within the Quire, there ſtood a large Iron Cheſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Iron Pillars, which was as high as the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery almoſt. It has a top like the Roof of a Houſe; Three great Iron Chains were laid over it, which were faſten'd at the bottom, on one ſide with Staples, at the other ſide with Three great Padlocks. When the Service was done, I asked one of the Chanoines what was contain'd therein: He ſaid, theſe following Relicks; We have here the Shift which the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <note place="margin">Relicks.</note> 
                  <hi>Mary</hi> wore when ſhe was delivered of our Saviour, and it has upon it, ſays he, ſome Drops of her Milk, which were ſhed in the ſuckling of him; there are alſo ſome of the Swadling Cloaths in which our Bleſſed Saviour was firſt wrapp'd; alſo the Cloth which was ticd about his naked Body when he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and a Cloth which was about <hi>John the Baptist</hi> when he was beheaded, on which are ſeen ſome Spots of his Blood. Theſe precious Things are ſhown with great Pomp and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94187:156"/> in the Gallery of the Church, once in Seven Years. To thoſe whom it doth or may concern, be it known that he told me, the next Year, being 1699. will be the Year of ſhowing them; I did not think it worth while to be ſo particular, as to ask him at what time of the Year this mighty Favour is granted to the World.</p>

The one ſort are thoſe within the inner City, which are the <hi>Caeſarian,</hi> the Little Bath, and the Bath of St. <hi>Quirinus.</hi> Another ſort are thoſe which riſe in the outer City, which are the <hi>Cornelian Bath,</hi> the <hi>Roſe Bath,</hi> and the <hi>Poors Bath.</hi> The third ſort are thoſe that riſe in a Neighbouring Village call'd <hi>Porcet,</hi> from the multitude of Wild Swine, which formerly had their Haunts there; theſe Baths are at the diſtance of about an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile from thoſe in the City, and riſe in a higher part of the Valley. All theſe Springs are very plentiful, inſomuch, that among them all they are judg'd to vent Ten Thouſand Tuns of Hot Water in a day. And they are ſo impregnated with Salts, that they will yield for every Tun of Water a Pound of Salt. They come with ſuch a heat out of the Spring, that they are forced to let them ſtand in Bathing-places a cooling Fifteen or Eighteen hours, before they are tolerable, or fit to Bath in. Over the Places where the Springs riſe they have built Houſes, which are divided into ſeveral little Rooms, in one Room
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94187:157"/> is the Pit or Cavity to Bath in, and in a little Room by it is a Bed to Sweat in, when they go out of the Bath. One Houſe will have three, four, or five of theſe Baths in it; they are laid with flat Stones, ſuch as are on Floors, at the ſides and bottom, are commonly about twelve or fifteen Feet long, and eight or ten Feet in breadth, and four or five Feet in depth, at the deepeſt. Theſe Houſes have alſo each of them a Room, where they that need it, ſit to have the Water pump'd upon them.</p>
               <p>The Drinking of theſe Hot Waters at <hi>Aix</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Drinking.</note> is within a few Years become a great and common Practice. They drink only of the Water in the outer City. A Pump is ſet for this purpoſe upon one of the Streams of that Spring which ſupplies the <hi>Cornelian Baths,</hi> which from the Chymical Experiments made with it, the Phyſicians call, A Sulphureo-falſo-Nitrous Water. The Pump ſtands in the Street, but is lock'd up ſo as that none can draw of it when the time of Drinking is over. It has by it two Piazza's, and an open Court for the Drinkers to walk in: From it there are three Spouts on three ſides of a Square, which one Man, who ſtands at the other, eaſily keeps running for the greateſt number of Drinkers. The Water comes from the Pump as warm as Milk from the Cow, and fit to drink. It ſeems to have no ill Taſte or Smell. I think our <hi>Chalybeate</hi> or Purging Waters in <hi>England</hi> taſte worſe. They drink of this Water, riſing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, to about an Hundred Ounces at the moſt, which may be computed at about four Quarts in a Morning. It has in ſeveral Bodies ſeveral ways of Operation: With ſome it paſſes
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94187:157"/> chiefly by Sweat, with ſome by Urine, and with ſome by Stool, and they are directed to follow the Inclination of Nature in the thing. But if they ſweat with it, they muſt go to Bed, and cover themſelves warm, and put on dry and clean Cloaths when they riſe. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters uſually paſs away, in thoſe whom they agree with, in the ſpace of three or four hours, and then they are fit for Dinner. They order the Drinking and Bathing of ſeveral People very differently, according to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſeveral Diſtempers, and as is found moſt agreeable to the Conſtitutions. But that which ſeem'd the moſt general and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Method, was, to drink in the Morning betimes, and to Bath in the Afternoon about four or five hours after Dinner.</p>
               <p>We were told, that the hotteſt of theſe Springs are at <hi>Porcet,</hi> we went therefore to <note place="margin">Porcet</note> ſee them. We took the lower way in going thither, and had a very Pleaſant Walk through ſome Meadows for a while. We came to a good Stream which we ſaw had upon it an under-ſhot Mill, which it could very well drive. When we were above this Mill, we found our ſelves upon a Foot Cauſway, which had on each ſide of it a brisk Stream of Water. We were told, and putting our Hands into both, found, that the one of theſe was warm, and the other cold; they both come down from the Hills about <hi>Porcet,</hi> and riſe not far from one another. Theſe two Rivulets, which hitherto run diſtinct, had upon each of them a Mill, which they drove, by falling upon the Wheels, which we call an over-ſhot Mill. Juſt above that Mill which the warm Water
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94187:158"/> drove, there is a large Mill-Pond, ſupported with a Dyke on one ſide, becauſe of the fall of the ſide of the Hill, and on the other ſide defended by a Dyke from the Brook of freſh and cold Water, which runs cloſe by it. This Pond breeds excellent Carps, and in great plenty. They are not thought to eat ſo well, taken immediately from hence and dreſs'd, as from other Waters, though they will grow very large and fat here. Therefore they uſually take them from hence young, and put them to feed and grow in other Ponds. The Miller makes of the ſelling theſe young Carps from hence, for that purpoſe, above an Hundred Rix Dollars <hi>per Annum.</hi> We obſerv'd, that a ſmall Spout of Water from the cold Brook was continually running into this Pond to give it a daſh of freſh Water; yet for all this, we could feel a manifeſt Warmth in the Water of the Pond, and that although we were ſomewhat the warmer for our walking. When we came to <hi>Porcet,</hi> we found the hot Springs riſe in a narrow Valley, between Two ſteep Hills. There are, we were told, above Thirty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Springs of hot Water here, many of which run waſte, and we ſaw a Stream of ſmoaking Water tumbling down by us in the Valley, with ſome Noiſe, which ſmoak'd as much as boiling Water thrown down. There are Fifteen bathing Houſes built here, and they have among them, Thirty Baths. We were guided to Two Pits of hot Water, which are open to the Air, which are reckon'd to have in them the hotteſt Springs of any in this Place. The Pits were about Four or Five Yards over, with Brick Walls round the ſides
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:94187:158"/> of them, which went to the bottom of the Pits, and ſtood above Ground almoſt Breaſt high; the Water in them ſeem'd to be about Five or Six Feet in depth. It ſeem'd to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whatof a pale blueiſh Colour, but was ſo clear, that we could ſee the bottoms of the Pits very eaſily. And from thence we ſaw innumerable little Bubbles continually riſe up; ſuch as one ſhall ſee in Water over the Fire, when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ready to boil, eſpecially if it be put in any thing that is bright and ſhining; and the Surface of the Water riſes in theſe Pits, juſt as Water does when 'tis ready to boil over the Fire. I doubt not to ſay, that the Water here is actually boiling hot. There was at each of theſe Pits a Place where we could put a Finger to the Water, but could no more endure a Hand or Finger in it, than in Water that boils over the Fire. Theſe Waters are certainly as hot as Water can be. They will boil Eggs in a little time; and the People take them up from theſe Springs, and uſe them, as Nature has fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, upon Occaſion, to ſcald the Hair off from a Swine, or Feathers from a Fowl.</p>
               <p>All the Waters, both here, at <hi>Porcet,</hi> and in the City, have this Property, that in the Throughs and Paſſages of Stone or Wood, through which they run, they leave in a little Time, a great Quantity of heavy ſandy Stone. The People are forced to how this very often out of thoſe Paſſages, otherwiſe they would be quite ſtopp'd up. The Porcetan Waters are reckon'd to have the moſt of this Quality, and to have it from hence, that they carry along with them ſomewhat more of that fine Sand, which is the matter of this Stone, though, as I
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94187:159"/> ſaid, theſe Waters are ſo clear and clean, that no ſuch thing can be diſcern'd in them. 'Tis judg'd, that this Stone comes from the mixture of theſe little Grains of Sand together with the Particles of Salts that are in theſe Waters, and which are coagulated by the cold Air. This Stone gathers no where, but where the cold Air, together with the Coldneſs of the Stone or wooden Troughs which the Water runs through, do chill it. And they ſay, the leaſt calcining, and almoſt the laying them by a hot Fire, reduces this Stone to a meer looſe Sand again preſently; the Saline Particles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken out by the Fire.</p>
               <p>Theſe Baths at <hi>Porcet</hi> are chiefly frequented for Pleaſure, by People that are well, who may tumble in them as long as they pleaſe, without any harm. The Circumſtances would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to try this Pleaſure. We were here led into a Houſe, to ſee what they call <hi>een Druogh Bade,</hi> that is, a dry Bath. We went into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cloſe Room, which was laid over a hot Spring. All the Furniture in it was a wooden Chair, and a Tin Pipe of about Three or Four Inches in Diameter. It conſiſted of ſeveral Joints, to be taken off, or put on, as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to be, ſhorter or longer. That which was to be always uppermoſt of theſe, was crook'd to a right Angle. In the middle of the Floor of this Chamber was a round Hole, fit for the Pipe to ſet in, this was ſtopp'd with a leaden Plugg. We felt the Chamber very hot at our firſt Entrance, but when the Plugg was taken out, and the Steam aſcended, it quickly grew ſo hot, that we could not endure it. We put our Hands to the Hole whence it came up,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94187:159"/> but could not endure to hold them there, the Steam came up ſo very hot. This Steam is by that Pipe, and the crooked end of it directed to any particular Part of the Body that is diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that the force of the Heat may fall chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that Part. Next this Chamber was another little one, with a Bed in it, which they go into from hence to lie warm, and Sweat ſome time. There are ſeveral of this ſort of Steam-Baths here, and in <hi>Aix.</hi>

               <p>BEing ſtraitned in time, we were forced hence before we could be aweary of ſo pleaſant, and diverting a Place. On the 27th. of <hi>May</hi> we took a Charrette, which we had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to our ſelves, to carry us from hence to <hi>Colen,</hi> we had therefore in our Charrette but one Horſe, but a ſtout one, and we paid for this Paſſage Three Guilders for each Perſon, though it was reckon'd it would take us up Two good Days travelling, by Reaſon that the Ways were become very bad, with much Rain which had fallen. We were to have gone from hence at Ten a Clock, but ſtaid for our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man till One, who hid himſelf, and loiter'd, to ſee if the Rain would hold up, it being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream wet Morning. When we went again to our Lodging, and he thought he ſhould loſe the carrying us, he ſoon after came to us with his Charrette. We ſpent a good Hour in croſſing the Valley of <hi>Aix,</hi> as we may call it, becauſe that City ſtands at one ſide of it. Our way through it, was upon a broad pitch'd
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94187:160"/> Cauſway. It was much broken, and out of repair, and we went on very ſlowly. On the other ſide of the Valley, from <hi>Aken,</hi> we met a little Brook, ſwell'd into a River with the Rains; it was ting'd of a reddiſh yellow Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, by the Grounds that it came from. Here we paſs'd through a large Village, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mounted a Hill; the pitch'd way went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us ſtill to the top of Hill, and there left us to lament the want of it, though it was none of the beſt, for we were no ſooner from it, but we expected, every length of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rette, almoſt to be thrown into ſome Slough of Mud. A great part of our Way from hence towards <hi>Juliers,</hi> was through a very rich Country, full of good Encloſures, and furniſh'd with Orchards, Paſture-Grounds, Corn-Fields, and Hop-Grounds, but ſome of the dirtieſt Countries that ever I ſaw in my Life. We went through a great many Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in this way to <hi>Juliers,</hi> and it ſeems a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try well peopled; but the Houſes of theſe Villages were the wretchedeſt that we had met with in all our Journey. They were large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but the Walls of them were of Clay unwhited. They are built with Timber, and are loftier than our common Cottages, which are of the ſame Colour in <hi>England.</hi> Some of them had a Glaſs Window, which might be cover'd with a quarter of a Yard of broad Ribbon, and a great many had none at all. They uſually ſtood with their end to the Road, and in that end, there is in the middle two great Gates, like our Barn Doors in <hi>England;</hi> a little way from that is a little Houſe Door. They commonly look like the meaneſt ſort of Barns
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:94187:160"/> in <hi>England.</hi> They were covered with a very thick covering of Thatch, and Clay together, which muſt require good Timber to bear it.</p>
               <p>We were now within the Province or Dutchy of <hi>Juliers,</hi> one of thoſe which makes <note place="margin">

               <p>The Dutchy of <hi>Juliers</hi> goes in ſome part of it to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> on the Eaſt, where it alſo meets, and bounds upon the Biſhoprick of <hi>Colen;</hi> it goes to the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> with ſome part of it, on the Weſt, where 'tis bounded with that, and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Liege.</hi> On the South, its Limits are the Dutchies of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> and <hi>Limburg.</hi> On the North, it meets the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves.</hi> The Extent of this Dutchy is reckon'd to be about Twelve Leagues in length, and Four in breadth.

His Dutcheſs died ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, in the Year 1596. <hi>Mendoza,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Spaniſh Armies, invaded the Country, and notwithſtanding the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sibylla,</hi> Siſter of the late Duke, with the Aſſiſtance which ſhe could get from her Neighbours, he poſſeſs'd himſelf of ſeveral of the Cities of that Juriſdiction. At length this Princeſs dying, the Family became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct in the Year 1609. Upon this a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie aroſe between the Marquis of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Neubourg,</hi> the Duke of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:94187:161"/> 
                  <hi>Deux Ponts,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Burgaw,</hi> all Pretenders to the right of Succeſſion by their Deſcents. At length the Controverſie fell to be between the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> only, the Pretenſions of the other being laid aſide. Theſe Two went to fighting about the matter, the Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burger being aſſiſted by the States General of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> by the Spaniards. When they were well aweary of this Sport, and could not determine the Controverſie in this Way, they agreed to divide the Spoil; and the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> was allotted the Dutchy of <hi>Cleve,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>Marck,</hi> and <hi>Ravensberg;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Neubourg,</hi> the Dutchies of <hi>Mons,</hi> or <hi>Bergen,</hi> and that of <hi>Juliers.</hi>

               <p>When we came near <hi>Altenhoven,</hi> and from <note place="margin">Altenho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> thence to <hi>Juliers,</hi> the Country was moſtly open and Champion, but plow'd and ſown, and ſhew'd many good Pieces of Wheat, and Rye, and good beginnings of Barley.</p>

                  <hi>Altenhoven</hi> is a wall'd little City, and the Head of a Juriſdiction round it, within the Province of <hi>Juliers,</hi> but the meaneſt City that we had ſeen. We obſerv'd the Wall to be in a ruinous Condition, and the Gate which we went in at was beaten down almoſt to the Ground. We went over Heaps of Rubbiſh in going through it. We ſaw in our way through the City, but one Houſe that look'd any thing well, and that was a Brick Building, which ſeem'd an Inn, all the reſt was old and ruinous. We only paſs'd through without ſtopping, and went out at another Gate, in the ſame Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the former.</p>

It is made up of a Confluence of ſome little Brooks which meet on the Frontiers of this Province.

               <p>Between Seven and Eight a Clock at Night we came into this City; it is but little, but a very ancient City. Some Authors think it was built by <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> others think it was the Work of <hi>Druſus,</hi> the Son-in-Law of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:94187:162"/> Caeſar,</hi> who for his Conqueſts upon the German People was call'd <hi>Germanicus.</hi> It is the head City of this Dutchy. The Latines call it <hi>Juliacum;</hi> the Germans <hi>Julich,</hi> or <hi>Gulich,</hi> and the French <hi>Juliers.</hi> In the Year 1622. it was taken by the Spaniards, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Marquis <hi>Spinola.</hi> The French King cauſed it to be reſtor'd to the Duke of <hi>Neubourg,</hi> in the <hi>Pyrenoean</hi> Treaty, made in the Year 1659, and ſince that time it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd under the ſame Sovereign. It is now well fortified, having about it a good Wall, and a Ditch, and it is defended by a ſtrong Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel, all which things ſeem to be in a good Condition, and we found a good Garriſon of Soldiers in it. The Streets are moſt of them ſtrait and broad, ſo that one ſees the Wall at one or both ends of them. There is one great Church in the City, which is Collegiate, and ſeveral others which belong to the Religious Orders. The great Church is dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> The Painting over the High Altar repreſents her feign'd Aſſumption. She is there painted, as aſcending in the Clouds, with many Angels about her, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and admiring her triumphal Aſcent. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her are the Pictures of an old Man and a young, holding between them a Crown, as ready to put it upon her Head, and over them is a Dove, with his Wings ſpread, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards her. There are ſome Jeſuites in this City, but they have no Houſe as yet. They have here in this Church a Chapel and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar which they attend, which is alſo dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Altar is adorn'd with a Picture of her Aſſumption. In this Church
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:94187:162"/> there ſtood upon their Carriages Three little Images, dreſs'd fine, which had been carried in a Proceſſion on the <hi>Sunday</hi> before, being <hi>Trinity Sunday,</hi> and perhaps were to repreſent to the People, the Trinity whom they were to worſhip.

Then they had Millſtones faſtned to their Necks, and they were caſt into the River. They roſe from the bottom of the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94187:163"/> River, 'tis ſaid, but not mention'd whether with or without their Millſtones, I believe 'tis all one, that Circumſtance being not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, was forgotten, and away they went to the other ſide of the River; but they muſt not eſcape ſo, they were ſeiz'd again, and now muſt experience a hotter Bath. A Caldron full of melted Lead was prepar'd for them, and they thrown, bound Hand and Foot, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: As the Executioners were throwing them in, they call'd for the Divine Vengeance upon <hi>Rictiovarus,</hi> upon which a drop of the melted Lead flew up, and alighted upon his Eye, which forthwith burſt. Enrag'd at this, he commanded that they ſhould add to the Lead Pitch, and Oil, and Greaſe; when all this was done, an Angel deliver'd them out of the Caldron. This Deliverance ſo vexed their Perſecutor, that he for Madneſs threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Fire. And here their Story ends, for it is not ſaid how, or when they came to their Deaths at laſt. But herein we have a Specimen of what a learned Man has ſaid, That the Acts and Martyrdoms of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, in the Hands of the Papiſts, have ſuffer'd a terrible Perſecution and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as they did themſelves from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. For by the Stories of Acts and Miracles, apparently feign'd, which they have mingled with the Truth, they have diſcredited what is true, and ſullied the Glory of their Sufferings. It is obſervable here, that they make theſe Men a very ſorry ſort of Saints or Martyrs, when they ſay they flew upon their Tormentours, and kill'd as many as they could of them, and that they imprecated a Vengeance upon <hi>Rictiova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:94187:163"/> Our Saviour and his Apoſtles ſet them a better and more glorious Pattern; but 'tis likely the ignorant Inventor of this Story was little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Behaviour; ſuch Saints as theſe the Spirit of Popery may make, but not the true Spirit of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>When we came into the City we heard a <note place="margin">Bells.</note> mighty Noiſe of Bells, which they were jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, after their Faſhion, in the great Church: We went in, as ſoon as we could, and found a Perſon there to enquire of, what the Occaſion or Reaſon of this ſhould be; for we knew it was not to call People together to Church at this time. He ſaid they had an ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in this City, of ringing the Bells thus every Evening through the Month of <hi>May,</hi> from Seven a Clock to Eight; and this the Burghers of the Town were bound to do by Turns. I ask'd him what this was for. He ſaid, It was that the good God might ſend a kindly Seaſon, that there might be a good Spring, and a fruitful Year. Here we found their Bells uſed to that purpoſe for which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does ſo ridiculouſly and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly conſecrate them. And this calls to mind what I have elſewhere obſerv'd, that when there has been a Storm of Thunder and Lightning, which has continued a while, all the Bells in a great City have been jangled and clatter'd to drive it away. This ſilly uſe of their Bells the People are taught by the Forms of bleſſing them before they are hung up; ſomething of which it may not be amiſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert here. There is requir'd a Biſhop and a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con to the Performance of this ſolemn and important Buſineſs. They both muſt be in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:94187:164"/> their Habits proper to Officiate in. The Bell muſt be hung ſo as it may be gone round, and may be touched within and without. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop muſt be provided with an adorn'd Chair to ſit on, and with Water to be conſecrated, with a Whisk to ſprinkle it upon occaſion, with a Saltſeller, and Salt in it, with a clean Cloth to wipe the Bell when neceſſary, with a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Holy Oyl of the Sick; with the Holy Chriſm, which is the conſecrated Oyl for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and with Myrrh and Frankincenſe, and an Incenſe-Pot, with Fire in it. Thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he goes to Work, and after a great deal of croſſing and conjuring, he ſays this, among other fooliſh Prayers, to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O God, who didſt direct thy Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> to to make Silver Trumpets, with which, while the Priests ſounded at the Time of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the People by the ſweet ſound might be admoniſh'd and prepared to worſhip thee, and to come together to the Celebration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and by the noiſe of which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd to the Battel, they might overcome the Endeavours of their Enemies: Grant, we beſeech thee, that this Veſſel prepar'd for thy Holy Church may be <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> ſanctified (at the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Word he makes the Sign of the Croſs upon the Bell) by the Holy Ghoſt, that by the striking of this thy Faithful People may be invited to their Reward: And when the Melody of it ſounds in the Ears of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they may be encreas'd in the Devotion of Faith; all machinations of the Enemy, the ratling of Hail, the ſtorm of Whirlwinds, the violence of Tempeſts, may be drove away;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:94187:164"/> that miſcheivous Thunders may be quieted, the blasts of Winds render'd helpful and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; that the Right Hand of thy Power may conquer all the Powers of the Air, and they hearing the ſound of this Bell may trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fly before the Banner of the Holy Croſs of thy Son drawn upon it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Bells may without doubt be lawfully uſed to admoniſh and call together the Aſſembly to the worſhip of God, as the Trumpets were by the Prieſts in the Jewiſh Temple, and thus far we follow the Pattern which God himſelf has ſet us: But this does not content Superſtition, it will in ſome things go beyond what it has any Ground for, as in other Caſes it ſcruples and declines what it might do. If there had been any Intimation in the Law of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Prieſts Trumpets ſhould have ſuch Effects as theſe, we might reaſonably enough hope that our Bells would have the ſame, that the Goſpel Diſpenſation might not, in any important Privilege, come behind the Jewiſh; but we find nothing of this, and therefore we leave this ſuperſtitious Uſe of Bells to the Papiſts; while we teach and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour rather that our Conformity to the Laws of the Goſpel may render the Divine Providence favourable to us. 'Tis certainly a great Snare to the World, to be taught that they may by any ſuch fooliſh and conjuring Tricks, procure the Divine Favours, rather than by the Exerciſes of Faith and good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and it commonly betrays them to the neglect of theſe Means. Something to be ſure was in the way, for notwithſtanding all this
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:94187:165"/> jangling, the whole Country was at this time miſerably puniſh'd with exceſſive Rain, and we greatly incommoded with the Badneſs of the Ways.</p>

               </head>
               <p>COnſidering them, we got up very early the next Morning, having a long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Journey, as the Ways were, to reach to <hi>Colen.</hi> We paſſed through a Valley for about the ſpace of half an Hour, upon a pav'd Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, from <hi>Juliers,</hi> between rich Paſtures and Corn-Fields. Then we gradually mounted to a higher Country, but the Soil being a ſort of Clay, it was very wet ſtill. Soon after our aſcending, we enter'd a vaſt Wood, which our Foreman or Charioteer call'd the Wood of <hi>Steintraſſe,</hi> from a Village of that Name, which <note place="margin">Steintraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.</note> we paſs'd through at the edge of it. There was a very broad Track through the Wood, which is the Road, and it is pretty ſtrait, ſo that we commonly could ſee ſome Miles before us; but as broad as the Road was, we could hardly pick out a tolerable Path, the Ground was every where ſo ſoft and full of Water. The tall Wood was chiefly Oak and Beach; there was a great deal of Underwood, for the moſt part, and that was Alder chiefly, which grows on moiſt Grounds beſt; all the Wood ſeem'd very flouriſhing, and large in its kind. There were cut in this Wood many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Palliſado's, I ſuppoſe deſign'd by the Government for the Improvement of ſome Fortifications. In all this Paſſage, which was
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:94187:165"/> of ſeveral Hours through this Wood, we ſaw to wild Beaſt, though without doubt there are of ſeveral ſorts here, only one Deer walk'd croſs the Road at a diſtance before us. We ſpent I believe, at our ſlow Rate of travelling, Three Hours in and by this Wood.</p>
               <p>This Village of <hi>Steintraſſe</hi> was all over Mud and Dirt. The People trod almoſt to the mid-Leg in Dirt when they ſtept out of their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Walls of their Houſes were unwhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Clay, and the Cover Thatch and Clay mingled. We ſaw on one ſide ſome plough'd Grounds belonging to the Village.</p>
               <p>About Eleven a Clock before Noon we came to the River <hi>Erpe,</hi> or <hi>Erffe,</hi> which we <note place="margin">Erpe <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
                  </note> were to paſs to <hi>Berghem,</hi> on the other ſide of it. This River riſes on the Frontires of this Dutchy, Southward, and runs into the <hi>Rhine</hi> by <hi>Nuys,</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Colen.</hi> It was now exorbitantly ſwell'd by the Rains, and put us in ſome Care how we ſhould get over it. There is a Foot Cauſway rais'd a little through the Meadows, which goes to a ſmall bridge over the River, but now Bridge and Cauſway both were cover'd with Water. And though it was common for Charrettes with their Paſſengers to ford it conveniently enough, we could not have done this now without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wet, even in our Charrette, almoſt to the Waſte; and beſides, our Horſe, who muſt for ſometime ſwim, would have been hard put to it to have had any thing more to draw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Charrette and Driver. We therefore, with the Company of Two other Charrettes, went into a ſorry <hi>Naken</hi> to be ferry'd over. The River run very fierce, but we went croſs
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94187:166"/> on the lower ſide of the Foot Cauſway, which ſomewhat defended us from the force of the Stream. We got over ſafe, Thanks be to God, and went to our Dinner at <hi>Berghen,</hi> while we left our Foreman and his Horſe to take theirs on the other ſide. This is a ſmall wall'd City, but ſeems poor and inconſiderable, but is the head of a ſmall Juriſdiction about it. Here is a Synagogue of Jews publickly tolerated.</p>
               <p>After Dinner we purſued our Journey, tho' very ſlowly, becauſe our Horſe fell ſick. And beſides this, after we had gone a little way upon a Level we began to mount the Hills, which we ſaw when we were on the other ſide of the River. We could ſee this Ridge of Hills for a great length together, both upwards, and down the River, and it ſeem'd to go on both Ways beyond our ſight, Northward and Southward. It lies along very ſteep on this ſide, towards this River, which occaſions a ſudden ſhoot of the Water from it, and by conſequence the great ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this River. Theſe Hills are, however, in many Places ſuch, as that they are plow'd and ſown, and there are Orchards and Paſture-Grounds upon them to ſerve the Villages, which are thick ſet upon them. And theſe are ſhelter'd by frequent Woods which poſſeſs the ſteepeſt Parts of the Hills. When we had mounted upwards above an Hour, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that the Country roſe ſtill above us, and that our Horſe grew more faint, we took pity upon him, and contented our ſelves, ſince we could not poſſibly get to <hi>Colen</hi> with him this Night, to reſt here, that he might not be too far ſpent, and might be the better able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:94187:166"/> us on the next Morning. We were the rather induced to this, becauſe the Weather was now clear'd up, and we were in hopes the reſt of the Afternoon would be fair, and we were got a good way up the Weſtern ſide of the Hill, on which the Sun now ſhone very pleaſantly, we could have a large Proſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Country, and were upon a good dry Place for walking: And to all this, after we had enquired at ſeveral Houſes in this ſcattering Village, and were denied, at length we came to one which promis'd us a Bed. It was a new Houſe too, and ſo, we ſuppoſed, might not be ſo naſty as the old ones ſeem'd to be. Beſides, we were promis'd here, that if our Horſe ſhould not be able to travel next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Houſe would furniſh us with a good <note place="margin">Ichen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorp.</note> one that ſhould do our Buſineſs. The Name of this Village is <hi>Ichendorp.</hi> It lies ſcatter'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in ſeveral Patches of Houſes, diſtant from one another, on this ſide of the Hill. They have a handſome large Church, built of Brick. I had a mind to ſee both the Country Parſon, and his Church. It coſt me a Mile's walk to find his Dwelling. I came to a ſorry Houſe, where they told me he lodg'd, but he was not within; ſo I could ſee neither. I ſpent ſome time of the Afternoon in walking among the Woods which were near our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from thence had a large View of the Country. Here Nightingales and other ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Birds abound, and at this time fill'd the Woods with their charming Muſick. We went by Day-light to our Bed, which we found a very ſorry one, and therefore lay down in our Cloaths, as in like Caſes we were often
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:94187:167"/> forc'd to do in this Journey. We had one Relief in the Badneſs of our Lodging, that if we could not ſleep, we were entertain'd with the Nightingales in the neighbouring Woods, who ſung ſweetly all the Night. We rouſed betimes, and found our Horſe ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited, and thought able to carry us to <hi>Colen;</hi> and in the ſpace of Six Hours he brought us thither with much ado. From our Lodging we aſcended a good while. Towards the top of the Hill, we found our ſelves in a Wood, and had ſeveral ſucceſſive Aſcents in that. We were ſome Hours upon this Ridge of Hills, before we came to look down on the other ſide of it; and we paſs'd through ſome Villages and manur'd Grounds, intermingled with the Woods. At length we came on the other ſide, where we could ſee <hi>Colen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Deſcent on this ſide was more gradual than our Aſcent on the other, the fall of the Ground being not ſo ſteep and ſudden. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bottom of the Hills we turn'd out of the Road to ſome neighbouring Villages, to find a better way croſs the Valley, which we did, and had ſome Pleaſure in this part of our Journey. This Valley is, I believe, Four or Five Miles broad in the Place where we enter'd upon it, and was in all our way plow'd and ſown, and open. We went between ſome of the richeſt, fineſt Crops of Wheat and Rye that I had, I believe, ever ſeen in my Life. The Soil is a good Mould, but perhaps a little of the drieſt, whence this wet Seaſon made the beſt of it. Within a Mile of <hi>Colen</hi> we came into our miſerable Road again, and found it ſuch, as we had Reaſon to wiſh we could have
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:94187:167"/> gone ſtill beſides it. I ſuppoſe the extream Badneſs of theſe Ways to be together with the ill Weather, from their being much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented with heavy Carriages, which paſs from <hi>Colen</hi> up into the Country, with ſeveral ſorts of Goods; and, I believe, <hi>Aix la Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle</hi> is furniſh'd, beſides other Places, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things from hence, eſpecially in the time of Year when thoſe Baths are reſorted to. We ſaw in this part of our Journey ſome part of Three ſeveral Proceſſions in the Villages we paſs'd through, for this was a great Day of Proceſſions with the Romiſh Church, as will be obſerv'd in the following Section.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Ubians,</hi> a People of <hi>Germany,</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> who dwelt along the oppoſite Bank of it, from <hi>Mentz,</hi> down to this Place, were grievouſly infeſted with the Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſome neighbouring People, who were too ſtrong for them. The Inſcription here
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94187:168"/> calls them the <hi>Suevi,</hi> who were thus trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Some call them the <hi>Chatti,</hi> or <hi>Catti,</hi> or <hi>Chaſſi.</hi> They were ſeated beyond the Country of the <hi>Ubians,</hi> from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and all along on their Borders. The <hi>Ubians</hi> vexed, and almoſt oppreſs'd by this People, ſought the Alliance of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and his Aſſiſtance againſt theſe their Enemies. But whether they were aſſiſted by the Romans or not they grew by this Diſturbance a weary of their Country; and in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> were, upon their Deſire, brought over the <hi>Rhine</hi> to this ſide, under the Conduct of M. <hi>Viſpanius Agrippa,</hi> Conſul. The <hi>Chatti</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fell into, and took Poſſeſſion of the Country which they left.

               </p>
               <p>In all this here appears no Engagement of Subjection on one ſide, or Pretence to Authority on the other; and the thing looks more like an Agreement between Allies, than an Acknowledgment, or accepting of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty. It is evident the Archbiſhip is not to be accounted the Supream Governour, or Sovereign of this City; but the Sovereign Power is properly lodg'd in the Senate; and to them the People make no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Promiſe of Subjection. Indeed, it were abſurd and unreaſonable that any ſuch ſhould be implied or expreſt in the Peoples Acknowledgment of the Sovereign. For this Fancy in the Heads of the People, that they are no longer bound to be ſubject, than while the Power rules them well, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves all their Rights and Properties, gives
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:94187:170"/> them the Pride of Cenſuring the Actions of their Rulers, and they will condemn and diſlike for the moſt part, and certainly and always whatever they do not underſtand; and there is no wiſe Government but will do and order many things which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt not underſtand till they have their Effects, that the Good they deſign by them may not be prevented. This Fancy makes them very apt to be jealous and ſuſpicious of the Deſigns of their Governours. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is no State which is deſtitute of ill Men, ſome of whom will have Deſigns of Revenge and Miſchief upon others, ſome will have Deſigns of Covetouſneſs and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and all ſuch, for the ſake of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing thoſe Deſigns, will be fond of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves a ſhare in the Government; and to that purpoſe they will be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allarming the People with Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, miſinterpeting the Actions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Governours, and repreſenting they do infringe their Rights, or tend to get Power to do it; and then they form a Faction, which by Degrees may grow ſtrong enough for Sedition and Rebellion. Thus the Supream Power becomes firſt too weak to govern, and to give the People the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of a good Government, and when they deſign well, things ſhall, through the Perverſneſs of the People, ſucceed ill, and be imputed to ill Deſigns; and the Good which they do not, becauſe they cannot, ſhall be thought neglected, becauſe they would not do it. Then the People grow mad enough to venture the dangerous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:94187:170"/> of changing Governours, or Forms of Government; and then theſe ill Men gain their own Ends. They are accounted mighty Patriots and Friends of the People, for bringing them into Confuſion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and ſhall be thought the fitteſt to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, who were the proudeſt, and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be govern'd, and the juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God often leaves the infatuated Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be plagued by the Tyranny of their new Governours, for their Injuſtice to their old ones, and brings upon them what they unreaſonably fear'd, by the ill Means which they uſed to prevent it. The City of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> indeed, being upon ſuch Terms as they are with the Archbiſhops, muſt be juſtified in their Defences of their ancient Privileges againſt them. Several Archbiſhops have ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hard to gain the Sovereignty of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the City has hitherto ſteadily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their Freedom from that. One Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, in the Year 1297, thought to make them ſubmit to him by Force, and gather'd an Army, and was marching towards them for that Purpoſe. The Citizens knowing this, put themſelves in Arms, and met him. They laid the Keys of their City in the Field, as the Price of the Victory, and then bravely fought for the Right to keep them ſtill themſelves. The Providence of God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd their juſt Endeavour, and they utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defeated the Biſhop's Forces, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign together. They return'd with Joy and Triumph to the City, and celebrate the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this important Victory ſtill, upon the Day on which they gain'd it. The

And we came hither in a good time to ſee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of this Day, which are ſome of the greateſt and moſt ſolemn Proceſſions of the whole Year. As we were going to our Inn, we met one which ſtaid us almoſt an Hour to ſee it paſs by. The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> march'd foremoſt in this Proceſſion, carried and attended by Queaſils ſinging, if it be proper to call an Image her; which yet we may do, when we are giving an Account of their Matters, becauſe they themſelves do ſo; and an Image in any Place is call'd the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> of that Place. The Image of her at <hi>Loretto,</hi> is as famous among them, under the Name of our <hi>Lady of Loretto,</hi> as that of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was under the Name of <hi>Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> But may it not be ſaid, that this Phraſe implies plainly, that they believe the Image not only a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Saint, but a Symbol of her Preſence in ſuch a Place. This Image was but ſmall, about the height of a Child of Three or Four Years old, but dreſt very fine, with a Robe of Cloth of Silver, a Crown on her Head, and a Scepter in her Hand. After this, ſeveral other Images were carried, of He and She-Saints, intermix'd with Banners, which are commonly long taper'd Flags, with a Picture of ſome Saint in the broad part of them. At the end of the Pole they hang upon, is commonly faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a good large Croſs of Silver. There were
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94187:173"/> ſeveral Images of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> carried, one of which, as big as a Child of Two Years old, ſeem'd, and was ſaid to be, all maſſy Silver, that was carry'd by Six Men. There attended this Proceſſion Two Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Men, the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> and the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guctines,</hi> theſe laſt ſung as they went along. Many Men and Women of good Faſhion appear'd in this Train. After all the Images, came the Men who honour'd the Hoſtie, by carrying lighted Flambeaux's before it. They march'd Two and Two in great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and were a great while a going by. I doubt not there were ſeveral Hundreds of them. Several genteel little Boys went ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Silver Bells before the Hoſtie. The Canopy over that was of Silk, with a rich Gold and Silver Fringe hanging down from it. A Secular Prieſt carried the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, in his Surplice and Cope, his Cope richly embroider'd with Gold and Silver. The Remonſtranter was large, with a great. deal of Work in it, and of Silver gilt.</p>
               <p>Let us make a few Reflections upon theſe Matters, before we paſs on to other things. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has eſtabliſh'd and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd theſe Things. It ſays, The Worſhip due to the True God, ought to be given to the moſt Holy Sacrament. And it is a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome very piouſly and religiouſly brought into the Church; That every Year, on a certain particular Feſtival-Day, this Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and Venerable Sacrament be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſingular Veneration, and Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that it be reverently and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly carried about in Proceſſions through
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:94187:174"/> the Streets and publick Ways; and it cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thoſe who ſhall contradict and condemn theſe Things. But we ſhall venture to do this, however, being aſſur'd that the Curſe cauſeleſs will not come.</p>
               <p>As for this Feſtival, they do themſelves <note place="margin">The Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival.</note> confeſs, that it has no Teſtimony or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Scripture, or Apoſtolical Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or even in the Hiſtory of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church for ſeveral Ages.

They ſay, the very Sacrament is to be worſhipped; all that which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour inſtituted to be receiv'd; and that it ought to have paid to it the very Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Worſhip which is due to God himſelf. They urge indeed for this the Adorations which were paid to our Saviour when he was on Earth; and ſay, that he is perſonally preſent in the Hoſtie, with his Body and Blood, and therefore ought to be ador'd there. But, without diſputing the manner of our Saviour's Preſence in that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which is certainly inexplicable, we may ſay, that thoſe who ador'd our Saviour on Earth, did not adore his Cloaths too, but only his excellent Perſon, as he was Son of God. But here they enjoin the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Species, or Appearance of the Bread, which they muſt allow at leaſt to remain, and which is, according their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the matter, to his Body in the Sacrament, what his Cloaths were to it on Earth, that is, the Covering of it. Yea, moreover we will venture to ſay, they adore the Elements themſelves of Bread and Wine,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:94187:175"/> becauſe of his Preſence with them. 'Tis true, they pretend that the Subſtances of theſe vaniſh upon Conſecration, and are there no more; but as matter of Fact has often confuted this, in the Corruption of the Wafers when they are kept too long; ſo they ſeem to confeſs the Falſhood of it in the Rules of the Paſtoral. Where they ſay, 'tis neceſſary to keep the Euchariſt in the Sacriſty, for the Communion of the Sick; but leaſt the Species ſhould be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, if kept long, the Prieſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take out the old Hoſties of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and to put in new ones. This he can well enough do, by eating himſelf, or giving to thoſe that receive, the old ones which were conſecrated formerly, and by putting in their Places thoſe which at that Maſs he conſecrates anew. Now this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which they take this Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, is what indeed the Subſtances of Bread and Wine may be liable to; but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Body of our Bleſſed Saviour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo; therefore we certainly have not that here in the ſtead and place of the Subſtances of the Bread and Wine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Holy Scripture teaches us, that theſe remain after Conſecration, and that 'tis ſtill Bread and Wine which are taken, ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They worſhip therefore moſt certainly theſe very Creatures, of Bread and Wine, with Divine Worſhip, in adoring the Holy Sacrament. We do juſtly own, that our Saviour Chriſt, who is God as well as Man, is to be worſhipped, as preſent, in
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:94187:175"/> the receiving of this Sacrament, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we do then worſhip him. But we muſt underſtand, that the Promiſe of his Preſence in, and with this Sacrament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Their Proceſſions are, as they ſay, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <note place="margin">Proceſſions.</note> Sorts; ſome of them are for Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God or the Saints, for Favours receiv'd; ſome are of Penitence, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Calamities which they are under, or do fear. They carry the Images of the Saints, and ſometimes their Relicks, in theſe to honour the Saints. I have ſeen, though not at this time, here, that on this Day there have been fine Altars ſet up in the Streets where the Proceſſion was to be, and there, when the Hoſtie came to the Place, it was ſet up, and he that carried it perform'd ſome Devotions; all the People who attended the Proceſſion being the while fallen on their Knees in the Street. When they go in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence they ſay they do this to make ſome Satisfaction for their Crimes, and to pray to God for his Mercy and Forgiveneſs, in the Company of the Saints, whoſe Images they carry, that they may be aſſiſted by their Prayers alſo, and ſo be the more likely to ſucceed. 'Tis well confeſs'd. It ſeems then,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:94187:176"/> by this Explication of the matter, they reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they have the Company of the Saints, when they have the Preſence of their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; they judge them in a manner link'd together. This was the very Opinion which the Heathens had of their Images, and the Foundation of the Veneration which they paid to, and of the Uſe which they made of them. Indeed this Pomp of Proceſſions, and carrying the Images of the Saints, is an old Heatheniſh deteſtable Rite, reviv'd in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Cuſtom and Name of theſe things are taken from the Heathen Romans. The Emperors, when they went to any publick Devotion, were ſaid to go in Proceſſion, and they were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a pompous Train. <hi>Dis Choul</hi> honeſtly gives the following Account of the Heathen Proceſſions, and makes them paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the Popiſh ones. It was the Office of the Prieſt (ſays he) to make Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which we call Proceſſions; that they might give Thanks to their <hi>Demons</hi> for a Victory gain'd, and ſometimes that they might avert the Anger of the Gods. And when the Prieſts made their Supplications through the Streets, they carried the Image of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and in ſeveral Places they ſet up this Image, in a Place prepar'd for it. Which thing, ſays he, is ſtill done in <hi>France,</hi> on the Day of the Holy Sacrament, <hi>(Rel. Vet. Rom. p.</hi> 222) So far has the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> herein departed from the Primitive Chriſtian Church, that they have reſtor'd ſome of thoſe Pomps and Vanities of the Wicked World, which thoſe Chriſtians oblig'd
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94187:176"/> all their Converts, upon their receiving Baptiſm, to renounce.</p>
               <p>After Veſpers, in the Afternoon, a Jeſuite <note place="margin">Jeſuites.</note> preach'd in the great Church, call'd the <hi>Dome.</hi> He had a vaſt Congregation of all ſorts of People, and laid about very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with his Hands and his Tongue, for about Three quarters of an Hour. He preach'd cover'd, as the Popiſh Clergy and the French Proteſtants do: The former, as Fathers dictating to their Children; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as Embaſſadors from God to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which by this ſignificant Ceremony, and a very Popiſh one, they repreſent; they think indeed of their coming from God, but not of coming with him, or that they deliver his Meſſage in his Sight and Preſence. 'Tis indeed that to which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Nature is very liable and prone, to honour it ſelf, even rather than the Great God; and 'tis no wonder if it affects, and chuſes to put on the Authority of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him, rather than the Humility of reverencing him; or if the former makes them forget and neglect the latter, even in a Caſe where they might be join'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Jeſuite, when ever he mention'd the Holy Sacrament, the Subject of his Diſcourſe, pull'd off his Cap. We could underſtand but ſome Words of his Diſcourſe, becauſe he preach'd in High Dutch. When he had done, great part of his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we, among the reſt, went down from this Church to the Jeſuites Chappel, they to finiſh the Devotion of this great Day, and we to ſee it done. A multitude
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:94187:177"/> of People were gather'd thither, many Coaches ſtood about the Door, and we were crowded in going in before they begun. We got into one of the Galleries where we could ſee all that was done, without complying. The whole Service was perform'd in Muſick, but it begun and ended with a general ſinging of the whole Congregation, which I had not ſeen before among the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts. And that which made this the more charming, was this, The Jeſuites had planted all their Scholars, which were a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in the Allies of the Three Iſles of the Church, there they kneel'd in Rows from one end to the other of the Church, which is a large one. They were taught to ſing, and perhaps had ſome to lead them. They ſung very exactly, in time with the Organ, and other Muſick, and made alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a very pleaſant Harmony. The fine harmonious Singing of the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the Lutherans, who abound in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſpend much of the time of Publick Worſhip, in ſinging altogether, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after Sermon, their Pſalms, and Hymns and Spiritual Songs, has made the Jeſuites betake themſelves to this moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Cuſtom; whereas ordinarily, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Quire, or the Organ Gallery alone, make the Muſick, and all the Congregation muſt only ſilently hear it.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of this Service, call'd <hi>Compline on H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:94187:177"/> manner: The Prieſt in a grave, ſolemn Pace, brings the Hoſtie upon the Stage, with lighted Tapers, and little Bells ringing, carried before him; he ſets himſelf in the middle of the Stage, with his Face towards the People, holding his Remonſtranter with the Hoſtie in it before him towards the People, and moves it and himſelf ſucceſſively ſomewhat towards each ſide of the Church; while he ſtands and does this, all the Congregation are upon their Knees, and all were here ſinging: At length he gravely ſets it upon the Altar, makes his ſcrape to it, and then comes down to the Steps, and there kneels with his Face towards it during the Service; in which he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do when 'tis perform'd in Muſick, but only to ſay a Prayer or two, during which the Muſick ceaſes; but with a curious Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of all the ſorts of Muſick together it ſounds the <hi>Amen.</hi> While the Service was performing, we could obſerve the Church. The Prieſt, who officiated, was cover'd with a very rich Cope, on which one could ſee nothing but Gold and Silver: Had we been near enough, perhaps we might have ſeen ſtore of Pearls ſet in the embroidery, which ſometimes, poor Men, the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are wont to have. The Remonſtranter was a very large one, and the Work of it very Curious; it was, I ſuppoſe, of Silver gilt with Gold. The Ornament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar was Cloth of Silver, but with a broad and embroidery of Gold laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it in the form of three or four great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Portals, under every Arch was wrought an Image of ſome Saint, and behind him there
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:94187:178"/> was a Proſpect of Landſchape. This Altar was ſet off with a great deal of Riches, had many Silver Candleſticks with tall Wax Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers lighted in them, and many other things for Ornament of Silver, or gilded and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting Silver and Gold, and all theſe things were very artificially intermix'd as is uſual with bundles of Flowers. The Architecture of Marble above the Altar is in three Stories as it were, every one ſomewhat leſs from the lowermoſt; they include three Pictures one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, which have on each ſide of them Pillars, and Angels, and ſome Images of Saints; much of the carv'd Work was gilded with Gold. It look'd all together extremely beautiful, and reaches to the top of the Church, which is of a good Height. The loweſt piece of Painting, and the largeſt, is a repreſentation of our bleſſed Saviour's Aſcenſion, the Figures in it are very curiouſly drawn: The Hiſtory of the ſecond, I could not underſtand. The uppermoſt Picture was but too plainly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, their common impious repreſentation of the adorable Trinity. At the top of all, to crown the buſineſs, is, in the Stone-work, a Marble Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſitting with a Crown on her Head, and a Child in her Lap. We were entertain'd here with an excellent Conſort of Muſick well compos'd, and excellently perform'd for almoſt an hour, then the Prieſt at the Altar got up from his Knees, which I believe by this time did ſome Penance, and gravely took down his Wafer, and while the Boys and Congregation were all ſinging, he concluded the Show as he had begun it. In the Street, by the entrance of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:94187:178"/> their Chappel, there hung up in very large Frames, many Copies of Verſes which they had made their Scholars make in praiſe of the Holy Sacrament; one Frame contain'd thoſe in Latin, another thoſe in Greek; on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Street were two more, which, I ſuppoſe, might be ſome of the modern Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, or in the vulgar Tongue. Each Frame contain'd ſome ſcores of Copies, but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies were ſet in rows, and the joyning of one Paper to another was cover'd with a ſlip of gilt Leather. The crowd and hurry was ſo great, that we could not then read them, and the next day they were gone. The School which the Jeſuits have here, is oppoſite to their Chappel and College, in the ſame Street; it is a great Building, and ſtands on three ſides of a large Square, which has a high Wall to incloſe it from the Street. In the middle of this Square ſtands an Obelisk with the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> at the top of it; about the Pedeſtal are many fulſom Motto's, among others, this, <hi>Maria flos florum;</hi> to anſwer which, there were Pots of Flowers ſet at the four Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Pedeſtals. The Attributes and Honours here given to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> do not well anſwer the Inſcription upon the Arch over the Gate of this Court, where they have ſet in Latin that Text of Scripture, a little alter'd, <hi>Come ye Children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</hi>

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:94187:179"/> Years. The Quire end is quite finiſh'd; the Body of the Church has its Walls and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I think, rais'd to the height intended, but the Arches over the Pillars are not yet made; there is a Roof of Timber laid over this part for the preſent. The Steeple, I believe, is not above half finiſh'd, we went up to the top of it to take a view of the City, and ſaw in it two or three very large Bells; from the top, going round, we could ſee the whole City and the Country about it; only, when we look'd towards the Quire, the height of that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what confin'd our Proſpect upon the City.</p>
               <p>Over the High Altar, in the Quire, one ſees through a Lettice twelve Images ſtanding ſix and ſix on each ſide of a Crucifix. They are, I believe, about two Feet long, and are ſaid to be of Silver gilt with Gold; they are made to repreſent the twelve Apoſtles. The Croſs in the middle is gilt alſo, but the Body upon it is Silver ungilt: The Crucifix is ſomewhat taller than the Images. The Altar is, I think; dedicated to St. <hi>Engelbert:</hi> There lies at full <note place="margin">St. Engel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</note> length over the Images of the Apoſtles, an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of a Biſhop carv'd in white Marble which is deſign'd to repreſent St. <hi>Engelbert.</hi> It is ſaid of him, he was an Archbiſhop of <hi>Colen,</hi> who was murder'd by <hi>Frederick</hi> Count of <hi>Iſſenburg,</hi> and his own Uncle, for defending the Liberties of his Church, about the Year 1225. He is recommended by the Legend as having faſted in honour of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> conſtantly on every <hi>Wedneſday:</hi> Certainly a great Commendation, and an Inſtance of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Chriſtian, or rather Marian Piety.</p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:94187:179"/>
               <p>The Body of the Church has very few Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars in it, and they are I think only at the upper End; there are two at the Entrance of the Quire from thence; that on the left hand, as one ſtands towards it, is an Altar to Mother <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Anna,</hi> as the Papiſts call the Mother of the bleſſed Virgin. Over it there is for an Altar-Piece a carv'd Work of white Marble not very big, where are ſeen two Women; one of them holds a Child in her lap; another, with a Cover over her head, ſomewhat like that the Nuns throw over them as a ſhort Veil, puts an Apple or an Orange into the Child's hand, which he ſeems much pleas'd with.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:94187:180"/> could not remember; there is written at the top of the Work about it, <hi>Sacro ſanctae &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuae Trinitati;</hi> at the bottom are theſe words, <hi>Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti humanitati.</hi> This expreſſes the Dedication of the Altar. They may indeed as well erect an Altar to the human Nature of our Saviour diſtinctly and ſeperately conſider'd from his divine Nature, as to any of the Saints; but certainly, this is a divine Honour which is not due, and ought not to be paid to any Creature; and tho' the Perſon of our Saviour might be, and was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ador'd while he was on Earth, becauſe he is God as well as Man, yet 'tis to be believ'd no one did diſtinctly worſhip his human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo as that he might have expreſs'd what he did in ſuch words as theſe, <hi>Jeſu I adore thee as God for thy divine Nature, and I adore thee as Man too, or I give divine Honour to thy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature;</hi> which is the true and evident meaning of this Inſcription. Here were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up about this Crucifix many Hands, Arms, Hearts, and little Images in Wax-work, which were the Memorials of Favours obtain'd at this Altar as the poor People underſtood.</p>
               <p>Not far from hence, and as on that ſide, one enters the Paſſage which goes round the <note place="margin">An Image of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin.</note> Quire, is ſet up at the Corner againſt a Pillar an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> I think, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Altar at her feet.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:94187:180"/> Silk lac'd with Silver, was very large downwards. How fitly this repreſents the mean Condition, and the Modeſty and Contempt of the World, and Humility of that bleſſed Virgin whom the Son of God choſe to take his human Nature of, is eaſie enough to judge. This Image we ſaw was mightily reſorted to, while we waited for the Opportunity to ſee the three Kings. Many People came directly hither when they were entred the Church, and here fell down and perform'd their Devotions, ſome longer, ſome ſhorter, and then went out at the next Door or ſtaid to be preſent at ſome Maſs This I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was honour'd with at leaſt a dozen Wax Candles which were all this while burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and ſeem'd ſet to burn out at once.

And one poor Creature had been ſo far tranſported in Superſtition and Folly, as to preſent a Heart here; there was hanging at the Girdle of the Image a piece of Silver as broad as the Palm of a Man's Hand raiſed, and ſhaped in the form of a Heart. This is a folly frequently ſeen in the Roman Churches, and ſignifies without doubt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting of a Heart to the Virgin, which is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, if ever there was ſuch a thing in the World. I find in Scripture it is the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Son of God under the Name of Wiſdom, <hi>My Son, give me thy Heart;</hi> and it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart and with all thy Soul,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94187:181"/> as it is in Scripture, becauſe in that caſe, a Man's Heart is ſet on Riches, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes himſelf as it were to Wealth; it is no wrong to call this ſo, which is a giving up the Heart to a me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We were waiting, as I ſaid, to ſee the famous Relicks of the Three Kings; they are ſhown, I <note place="margin">Three Kings.</note> think, but once a day, and that not half an hour at a time. About nine a Clock in the Morning, we catch'd the Opportunity. They pretend to have here the Bodies of thoſe Perſons who were led by a Star to our Saviour at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> when he was newly born; whom our Tranſlation calls, Wiſe Men of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and the Papiſts Kings; they make their Number to be three, and have invented Names for them, which are, <hi>Gaſpar, Melchior,</hi> and <hi>Balthaſar;</hi> ſome give them other Names, and it appears from the Diſputes about the matter, that they are all invented. It is ſaid theſe Bodies were tranſported from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> to <hi>Milan,</hi> and from <hi>Milan</hi> to <hi>Colen.</hi> The ſame Bodies are pretended to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe, but that is a ſmall matter: If the whole Body of our Saviour from Head to Foot, as it hung upon the Croſs, can be in a thouſand places all of it at once, 'tis no great buſineſs for the Body of each of theſe Kings to be in two places at a time, and that altho' they ſhould be at the diſtance of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles from one another: But if they had had this Faculty when they were alive, they might have gone abroad and ſtaid at home at the ſame time; they might have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd their Subjects in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd our Saviour at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> all under one;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:94187:181"/> they might have taken a long Journey, and notwithſtanding that, have taken their Eaſe at the ſame time in their own Palaces. They lie here in a little Chappel which is behind the great Altar, and are ſeen in the Paſſage there. There is within the little Chappel, a Partition made with Iron-Bars, and clos'd at the top; this leaves but very little room for the Prieſts to go to the Altar of the three Kings behind it. Within this Partition is a ſort of Tomb, which almoſt fills that, ſo that two Perſons can hardly go breaſt round it. One Prieſt is at the Altar mumbling ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions to the three Kings, while another is within that Partition, with his Surplice on, making the Show. He opens two Lattices on the out-ſide of the Partition next the Iſle, and another Lattice at the Tomb it ſelf; and there ſtand two little Wax-Candles burning, ſo as to caſt a little light upon the Relicks: One ſees only what ſeems the Crowns of the Heads of three Men, or the tops of three Skulls, for the things look of the colour of Skulls. No Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons was ſuffer'd to come within where the Prieſt was, or to touch and feel what theſe things were: But many People about us had the Superſtition to give the Prieſts things to be touch'd by theſe ſacred Noddles, which he took and held to them with a pair of Silver Pincers. We ſaw hanging up here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, by a Form to kneel and pray at, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Litanies of the three Kings, as they are call'd. And for the encouragement of ſaying theſe, ſome days of Indulgence are granted to thoſe that ſhall ſay them in any place; but to thoſe who will come and recite
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94187:182"/> them here, more days of Indulgence are gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; accordingly, there were ſeveral People a good while upon their Knees before the Show began, who ſeem'd to be very buſie a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting theſe Indulgencies; ſome of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noines, before they went into the Quire, came and kneel'd down, and ſaid ſome Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers here.</p>
               <p>We ſaw ſeveral fine Churches with Altars, rich and neatly adorn'd, and tir'd our ſelves well with going about; we perceiv'd they abound in Relicks, every Church affecting to have ſomething or other which is counted valuable of this kind: I lamented that many of the Inſcriptions which expreſs this matter were in High-Dutch, and ſo I could but ſeldom make any thing of them; and to have found a Perſon at every Church that could and would give us an account of things in Latin, would have taken up more time than we had to ſpend here. Beſides, it is not at all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to know what Relicks they have, but only this would have been worth taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; namely, to obſerve what Veneration is to be paid to them, and what the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is that allures the People to it. And we muſt content our ſelves with a Specimen only of this matter, in what has been ſaid of the three Kings, and the Indulgence gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thoſe who ſhall come to their Tomb, and in what I ſhall further relate concerning the Minorites here.</p>
               <p>The Minorites have here a very large and <note place="margin">Minorites.</note> fine Church, as they are generally a good thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Company of People. At the Eaſt-end of the North Iſle there is a Chappel and Altar, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:94187:182"/> to the Infants of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> who were kill'd when <hi>Herod</hi> ſought to murder our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. The Piece of Painting over the high Altar, repreſents that Tragical Hiſtory. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that, between it and the Table, there lies along, carv'd in Stone, an Image of a Child, as laid aſleep. Before the encloſure of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, there is a Paper hung up in a Frame, which in words of Latin intimates, That in the Year 1300 and ſomewhat more, the Body of one of the Infants at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was ſent <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Infant of</hi> Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</note> from the Minorites at <hi>Venice,</hi> to thoſe at <hi>Colen,</hi> and that it was confirm'd and approv'd for true, by the Biſhop of <hi>Colen:</hi> And forty days Indulgence is granted to thoſe, who being ſo and ſo qualified, ſhall viſit this Chappel, and <hi>honour here with their Offerings</hi> the holy Infant. This is honeſtly ſpoke out, and ſhows us for what it is that Relicks are pretended to, and ſo much coveted and valued; it is for a pretence of Indulgences to thoſe who ſhall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit them, and they are granted for the ſake of Offerings; for 'tis always underſtood, even when 'tis not expreſs'd, that no Man obtains any Indulgence by being preſent at a Maſs at any Altar or Chappel whatever, unleſs he drops there his Offering great or ſmall, and which muſt be given according to his ability. Againſt a Pillar, on the other ſide of this Church, is a Picture of a Man at full length, which is pretended to be a true Picture of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and drawn as I remember from the Life; it has a pale meagre look, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he could not help, but it is melancholy and peeviſh too, which is a Fault in one that is pretended to be a mighty Saint; to their
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:94187:183"/> commendation be it ſpoken, theſe his Children, look much better. Under the Picture is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what is pretended to be the Bleſſing which St. <hi>Francis</hi> uſed over the People to deliver them from Plagues and Diſeaſes. It is all of it the ſame word for word, which <hi>Moſes,</hi> by God s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection taught the Jewiſh Prieſts to uſe; but, I think, it is not the whole of that I muſt not lanch into the Praiſes of St. <hi>Francis</hi> or, which is all one, go about to give an account of his Life; this is an Ocean in which, if I had one of theſe Brothers for Pilot, I ſhould yet be in danger of being loſt, as others have been I ſhall therefore refer my Reader to the <hi>Liber Conformitatum Sancti Franſcici cum Jeſu Chriſto,</hi> in <hi>Fol.</hi> written by a worthy Minorite, wherein he ſhall ſee how little St. <hi>Francis</hi> came below Jeſus Chriſt in his Life or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Paſſage from</hi> Colen <hi>to</hi> Duſſeldorp.</head>
               <p>VVHEN we came to <hi>Colen,</hi> we proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to have gone down the <hi>Rhine</hi> by Water; but upon enquiry, they told us, That at preſent no Boats went downwards; The reaſon of which was, that the <hi>Rhine</hi> was ſo ſwell'd with the great Rains, and had ſo overflow'd the Neighbouring Country, that they could not well find the Courſe of the Channel, and if any high Wind ſhould riſe, it would be very dangerous. This put us, who could not ſtay, upon a neceſſity of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling by Land all the way down this River from hence. Our Paſſage upon this account was more chargeable, and, I doubt not, more tedious too; for this very ſwift River, would, I believe, have carried us much faſter than we went by Land, at our ſlow rate of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling. We were reſolv'd, however, to ſee the chief Cities downwards from hence which ſtand upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and by our Land-travel had the better Opportunity of ſeeing what the Country is all the way.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>31ſt.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> then, we hired our Paſſage in a Charrette for <hi>Duſſeldorp;</hi> we paid but a Gilder for each Perſon, as I reckon'd; it was in the Money of the Country, thirty Stivers. <note place="margin">Money.</note> They reckon ſixty of their Stivers in their Rix-Dollar; but a Rix-Dollar, <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> which is otherwiſe call'd a Pattacoon, and goes ordinarily for forty eight Stivers in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> they reckon'd worth ſeventy two of their Stivers. To ſet down therefore our
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:94187:184"/> Expences as exactly as I could, while we were in theſe Parts, in a juſt proportion to the Netherland Money, I conſider'd the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between ſeventy two and forty eight, and found the former number exceed the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter juſt one third part: Therefore when I ſet down our Expences in this Money, which I did, till I came to <hi>Nimmeguen,</hi> I reckon'd in our Account, two thirds of the number of Stivers which they had of us. But it may be obſerv'd, that altho' we had the ſame propot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obſerve after this, yet the Money of <hi>Colen</hi> would go no further than in the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Duke of <hi>Neubourg,</hi> and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Neubourg</hi> would not afford us the value we took it at in the Country of the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> but we chang'd but little of our Gold at a time, and ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the leſs loſs: The Gold we carried was French <hi>Louis d' Or's,</hi> which yielded us the ſame Rate through all our Journey. We had but one Perſon in our Charrette, beſides two of us, and ſo had but one Horſe to draw us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is reckon'd a Paſſage of ſix or eight Hours by Land after this manner of Travelling. I believe we were near twelve Hours in paſſing, two of which were ſpent where we baited. Our Journey was, for the greateſt part of it, on the ſame ſide of the <hi>Rhine</hi> that <hi>Colen</hi> ſtand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> on, and alſo within the Biſhoprick of <hi>Colen:</hi> All our way was through a till'd Corn Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and open Fields. The ways of this day's Journey were very good, as the Weather was and we had ſome pleaſure in our Paſſage. I believe the goodneſs of the way, not ſo much due to two dry days, as to this, that the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:94187:184"/> Ground of this whole Paſſage was ſomewhat lighter, and leſs a Clay than that we had in croſſing the Country, but had in it very good Crops of Wheat and Rye; and, I believe, the chief Reaſon of it to be, that this way is not ſo much frequented or travell'd as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reaſon that, for the moſt part, People may paſs upon the <hi>Rhine;</hi> to be ſure, 'tis freed from heavy Carriages which do moſt harm to the ways, and which the Conveniency of the River frees theſe from. The Valley ſeems on this ſide, to be four or five Miles wide between the Hills we came over, and the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and it ſeem'd to be a flat on the other ſide, as far or farther. In our way this morning, we met a flock of fooliſh Pilgrims, they were Men, Women, and Children. Our Road was for the moſt part at a good diſtance from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and out of ſight of it. We paſs'd by <hi>Wering</hi> in the morning, leaving it at a diſtance on the right Hand; it ſeems a good large Town, and ſtands on the Bank of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Colen.</hi> About the middle of our way, we ſtaid to refreſh our ſelves at a Village call'd <hi>Dormagen;</hi> this, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Dormagen.</note> little Villages, with a ſmall compaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, on this ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd to the Dutchy of <hi>Mons,</hi> and ſo are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of the Duke of <hi>Neubourg.</hi> The Houſes of this Village look well, and ſeem as good as thoſe in the common Villages of <hi>England.</hi> After this, we paſs'd above <hi>Zons,</hi> a little City upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> on this ſide, which is alſo in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Colen.</hi> We did not go down ſo far as <hi>Nuys,</hi> on this ſide, but within a near view of it, and ſaw that it
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:94187:185"/> is a pretty large, and a fortified City. When we came to the River, there were other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies had juſt fill'd, and were gone off with the Ferry-Boat; ſo we were forced to be contented with a Naken. It was a great deal of trouble to ſtow upon this three Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rettes, one at each end, and one in the middle with their Horſes: This done, the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers went into another Boat, which was faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Naken, and ſo we were condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted over by two ſturdy Women, and an old Man. Each Perſon paid for himſelf two Sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers for his Paſſage. The violent Stream car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us, I believe, almoſt a Mile down the River in croſſing it; we got in at a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient and troubleſome place to land at, and our Charretes were longer a getting out than in. This Paſſage coſt us near two Hours. We were glad, and thank'd God, when we were got ſafe over this very broad and rapid River in a ſorry Boat, and with a great deal of encumbrance. We had from our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place, but an Hour and half to <hi>Duſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorp.</hi>

It is now a wall'd City, and has a good Fortification: 'Tis the head City of of the Dutchy of <hi>Mons</hi> or <hi>Berg,</hi> ſo call'd from the high and ſteep Mountains, which they ſay, 'tis full of. I ſpeak thus, becauſe we met with none of them in our way. We paſs'd thro' a plain Country to it, and from it, full of Corn Fields, which prov'd the goodneſs of the Soil, by the richneſs of the Crops which ſtood upon it. We ſaw no Hills but at a diſtance, beyond the reach of a diſtinct view, where indeed the Country ſeem'd to riſe very high, and the ridge appear'd to us as we were on the other ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> upon that ridge of Hills from whence we look'd down upon

                  <hi>Colen:</hi> We could there ſee it run as it were parallel to that which we were upon, a great way Northward and Southward, all the way continued, and it ſeem'd to run both ways beyond our ſight. This Dutchy of <hi>Berg</hi> is a part of the Circle of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> it is but of a ſmall extent, it lies along the <hi>Rhine</hi> on the Eaſt ſide, between the Country of <hi>Mark,</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Colen.</hi> This City is little at preſent, and ſo are the Houſes, they are built ſome of Timber, ſome of Brick, and generally but low; a new Street of Brick Houſes is lately built with the top of the Fronts after the new Faſhion, and the Houſes are uniform, and of an equal height. It is likely this will be the Faſhion of all the new Buildings intended. For 'tis ſaid, the City at preſent is too little for its Inhabitants; it ſeem'd indeed pretty full of People, but, I believe, it may cheifly be too little for the Vanity of the Prince: He is therefore at preſent upon the Deſign of making it bigger. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement will not be round it, but on one ſide. The Ditch is already almoſt finiſh'd, which is to encloſe the new Part; it is begun at the <hi>Rhine,</hi> upwards from the old Wall, and ſo runs up into the Country as far as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer City reaches; with ſome compaſs, and then turns towards that.

The Grand-father of the preſent reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prince, who was <hi>Wolfgang William,</hi> Duke of <hi>Neubourg,</hi> was the firſt of the Family that came hither.

The <hi>Brandenburger,</hi> on the other ſide, being ſupported by the States-General of the United Provinces, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to them, and to confirm them to his Intereſt, left the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion, and turn'd Calviniſt. This <hi>Wolfgang William,</hi> being chang'd himſelf, fiercely ſet himſelf to force all his People who had embrac'd the Reformation, to return alſo to the Follies and Idolatries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> being inſtigated to this by the Jeſuit <hi>Reihingius.</hi> His Son follow'd him in his Religion and Zeal for it, and in the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:94187:187"/> Year 1663, went about to Baniſh all that profeſs'd the Reform'd Religion out of his Countries.

The Father of this preſent Prince, is he whom we have laſt ſpoke of, he was <hi>Philip William;</hi> in his time, the Family of the Electour Palatine became extinct, and he of right ſucceeded to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity about the Year 1685: So the preſent Prince is now call'd Electour Palatine, after his Father. The preſent reigning Prince, is <hi>John-William-Joſeph-Ignatius,</hi> born in <hi>April</hi> 1658, of the ſecond Wife of his Father: She was a Daughter of the Family of <hi>Heſſe-Darmſtat,</hi> a Proteſtant before her Marriage, but ſoon after turn'd Papiſt, in compliance with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. The Siſters of this preſent Prince, which his Father had by ſeveral Wives, are very nobly Married: One is the preſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; another is married to the the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> another is the preſent Queen of <hi>Spain;</hi> One other is married to Prince <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the laſt was lately married to the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi> The Electour is a fair plump Man, and inclining to be corpulent;

She is from <hi>Italy,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Meditis,</hi> and I think, is Siſter to the preſent Duke of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> I was told of but one Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Electour that has Children.

For this we went up a Pair of Stairs at the end of a Piazza which runs along on one ſide of a Court. At the top of theſe we were in a Gallery which goes all along over it. About the middle, I think, of that we went into the Guard-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. There ſtood Yeomen of the Guard, cloath'd much like thoſe which one ſees atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our King at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and as richly cloath'd as they at leaſt. Then we came into an Antichamber, where a Set of Muſicians had been playing, during the Firſt Courſe, but had now done. Here ſtood the Sideboard-Table, it was a pretty large one, but was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanly furniſh'd for a Prince, and one that loves Pomp and Show; but I doubt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> at ſometimes it is better. Their Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſate together under a Canopy, at one
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:94187:188"/> ſide of a large round Table, the Electour on the Right Hand of the Electoureſs. The Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was, I think, red Damask, or Velvet, and with a Gold Fringe round it. There was an Italian ſinging when we went in, but the Room was hung, and ſpoilt the Muſick of his Voice, which was, too, but weak and ſmall. We ſtood at the Door of the Room where they din'd. There were, I believe, Eighteen or Twenty Pages who waited at the Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a Gentleman at each of their Highneſſes Chairs. The Pages were very fine, but in an old faſhion'd Dreſs, I ſuppoſe, though it was new to us. They had a Garment cloſe to their Bodies, and cloſe to their Arms; it came down with deep and broad Skirts, Four in all, a little below the Waſte. Their Breeches were turn'd in at the middle of their Thighs, and ſate upon them, as thoſe of our Rope-Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in <hi>England,</hi> but from thence downwards the Cloath came cloſe to them, below their Knees, like the Spaniſh Breeches. At the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of that Purſe, and of the lower part too, they were beſet thick with ſhort Knots of good broad Scarlet Ribbon. Their Cloath is Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, it is well laid with Silver Lace. I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgot that they had narrow hanging Sleves behind, which reach'd from their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to their Hams, the Cloath of theſe was almoſt hid with the Silver Lace They were fine in this Dreſs, and it became them well enough. They are young Men, but ſeveral of them of an extraordinary Size. I think I never ſee any Man at his full Growth taller then ſome of them, who had but Boys Faces. The Second Courſe was upon the Table when
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:94187:188"/> we came up. After ſome time the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men took it off, and the Pages brought it into the Room where we were, and other Waiters took it of them, and carried it down. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live there might be about Twelve or Sixteen Diſhes, great and ſmall. Then a Deſſert was ſet on, in which was a great quantity of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats. There were Three very large Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids in Diſhes, and many Plates, and little Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; the Table was well cover'd with theſe. At the ſide of the Table, oppoſite to their Highneſſes, ſtood a Carver, with Spoons and Forks by him. He ſerv'd them of all things, with what they deſired. In the Room where they din'd, and in the Anti-chamber, there was a very great Candleſtick hanging, with ſeveral Branches and Sockets for Candles. Both theſe ſeem'd, and were ſaid to be Silver, and if ſo, there is a great deal of Silver in them, and a great deal of Work, they look'd very great, and very fine.</p>
               <p>In the Afternoon, the Electour and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoureſs in one Coach, attended by People in about half a Dozen Coaches more, went out, I ſuppoſe, to take the Air. Their own Coach was but mean, and the reſt, as muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, worſe; but the Guards which waited <note place="margin">Guards.</note> upon them made a very ſplendid Appearance. There were about an Hundred Horſemen in all, with Officers, Trumpeters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They had all very fine Horſes, and thoſe of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, eſpecially, ſeem'd to be well bred. The Officers were fine, and even the common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers too. The common Troopers were cloath'd with blew Cloth, laced on all the Seams, and other fit Places, with Silver Lace. Their
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:94187:189"/> Hats had a broad Silver Lace round them. They had broad Shoulder-Belts, which were cover'd, I know not which is fitteſt to be ſaid, with Scarlet Cloth, or Silver Lace, but if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Two appear'd moſt, I think it was the Lace, which is of a good breadth, laid very thick, and with a Point in the middle of the Belt, it lay in the form of a <hi>Gheveron</hi> in a Coat of Arms. There were about a Dozen Trumpets, and Two Kettle Drums, the Cloth of their Coats was almoſt hid with the broad Silver Lace laid upon it. The Cloathing of the Kettle-Drums, as I remember, is Cloth of Silver, a deep Fringe of Gold and Silver went round the Drum at the top, and a leſſer one round about the edge of the Cloathing I never ſaw any thing of the kind ſo fine as theſe all were. And this is a particular Affectation of this Prince.</p>
               <p>The reigning Religion here is the Popiſh, <note place="margin">Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion here.</note> and the Papiſts are in Poſſeſſion of the publick Churches. We went into ſome of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſaw nothing in them very fine, nor any thing peculiar, or worth taking notice of. In the Yard belonging to the great Church ſtand Three Crucfixes, with Bodies on them; as big as the Life, to repreſent the Crucifixion of our Saviour between Two Thieves: There is a large Penthouſe over them. By the ſide of another Church we ſaw the ſame Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To theſe many People in paſſing by, paid a profound Reſpect; but without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Interpretation of theſe Books, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt be liable to pay the ſame Reſpect to thoſe which repreſent the Thieves, as to that which is deſign'd for our Saviour; ſo that in
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:94187:189"/> theſe Books there are certainly ſome things, as dangerous and as liable to betray People into damnable Error, and mortal Sin, as are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be in Scripture.

When we came to the City, after we were enter'd within the new Ditch, we ſaw ſeveral of thoſe little Oratories or Chappels, mention'd before, ſtanding about in the Fields, in each of which is an Altar and Image, and for the moſt part of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Among the Papiſts in theſe Parts the Controverſie is now hotly purſued, about the Immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception <note place="margin">Immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, the infallible Guide of the Church cannot tell what to do in this Caſe, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Meaux</hi> ſays, The Church has not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, whether the Virgin was born in Original Sin or not. The contending Parties are indeed ſo hot upon their Opinion, that they would
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:94187:190"/> either of 'em be apt to deſpiſe the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, if he ſhould venture to decide. The Pope's Authority is for a Scare-crow, ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants; but, upon Occaſion, the Papiſts can make little account of it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as Scare-crows are never wont to fright them that ſet them up. Biſhop <hi>Meaux</hi> ſays, 'Tis neither Hereſie nor mortal Sin, not to believe the Immaculate Conception of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; and yet he ſays, 'tis Pious to believe it. But if this be Pious, ſurely the contrary muſt be impious. If any Propoſition be true, the direct and full Contradiction to it muſt needs be falſe; and if any Opinion be pious, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which fully contradicts it, muſt deſerve a contrary Character, and conſequently be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted impious.

               <p>There are in this City Two Congregations of the Reformed Religion, the one <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> the other Proteſtant, or <hi>Lutheran.</hi> We ſpent <note place="margin">Lutherans <hi>here.</hi>
                  </note> the Morning of the Lord's-Day in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Congregation. They have not a very large Church, but it was well fill'd. It ſtands a little inward from the Street. I think they call their People together by a Bell. The Place is Oblong, with the Altar or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Table at the Eaſt end, and a good Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the Entrance at the Weſt end. Above that, is a little Gallery, ſet up for a ſmall Organ, that they might loſe no Room by it. The Church was very neat, but not fine. There were but Three diſtinct Pictures in it, and all very free from Popery or Superſtition. On
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:94187:190"/> the South Wall hung a Picture of <hi>Moſes,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Two Tables of Stone, on which there was only a Scrawl to repreſent the Writing of the Ten Commandments. The Communion-Table was large, and very high. It ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wall, upon a flat of Boards, raiſed a little Step above the Stone Floor of the Church, and which goes out at a good diſtance from the Table. Over this Communion-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or Altar, is a good Picture, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents our Bleſſed Saviour in his Agony in the Garden, with an Angel come to encourage him. There are Three of the Apoſtles aſleep, not far from him, and at a diſtance, the tops of the Torches of thoſe who are coming to apprehend him, appear from behind a Hill. The Hiſtory is well repreſented. Behind the Picture of our Saviour are black Clouds, well drawn, and amidſt them appears a bright round thing, which looks almoſt as if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to repreſent the Sun, veil'd with theſe Clouds; but it being a Night Piece, it muſt be underſtood, as it is intended, to repreſent the Wafer which they give and receive in celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sacrament of the Lord's-Supper, for they adminiſter the Bread in that Form. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this great Piece of Painting is another leſſer one, which repreſents our Saviour, with a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about him, as riſing from the dead, and treading upon a Dragon; to ſignifie, that he had now overcome Death, and him that had the Power of Death, as the Scripture ſpeaks, that is the Devil. This is a fit Repreſentation of our Saviour, but it is an impudent Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to attribute this to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as the Papiſts do in Pictures and Images of her, with
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:94187:191"/> which I have often ſeen a Snake or Dragon put under her Feet as dead. The Pillars on each ſide of theſe Pictures were wreath'd, their Chappiters handſomely carv'd, all the Work is very neat and decent, but the matter is not Marble, but Wood painted, in Imitation of Marble, ſome of black, and ſome of white Marble, ſtreak'd, and it is very well done. The Altar, or Communion-Table, was cover'd with a large Velvet Cloth, which reach'd to the Ground, of a deep blew Colour. Before the Worſhip began I had time to ſee what Books lay at the Reading Desk; and at the Desks of the People. The Reader had before him a great <hi>Folio</hi> Bible in High Dutch, and another Book in <hi>Folio,</hi> which had for its General Title, <hi>Spiritual Songs.</hi> I look'd into it, and obſerv'd there the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and other of the Scripture Songs or Pſalms; and alſo ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Hymns, compoſed by <hi>Luther,</hi> and other pious Proteſtants of their Communion. There were, I think, in one part of the Book, Forms of Prayer.</p>
               <p>The Worſhip here began about Eight a Clock in the Morning, and ended at Eleven. It was begun by a Reader, a grave ancient Man, who is the School-Maſter of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Children. He firſt read a ſhort Prayer; then he read ſeveral Chapters of the Old and New Teſtament, while the Congregation came together. When a good Number were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, they began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, with the Organ, their Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs. I obſerv'd many People, both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, fell in with the ſinging, without uſing their Books which they had before them very
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:94187:191"/> often; and the Children, who ſate together, very readily found what was to be ſung, though I ſaw it was taken out of ſeveral diſtant Places of their Books; which ſhows that they were all very well acquainted with their Liturgy. I perceiv'd, that in one place they ſung the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Creed; for a Perſon by whom I ſate, and who very civilly turn'd to, and ſhow'd me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that they ſung; at length pointed to what I underſtood to be that. This ſinging took up the greateſt part of the time of their Aſſembly. They all ſung with moſt perfect Concord, and Agreement with their Organ, which was very pleaſant; and, which was more pleaſant, they did it with greateſt Seriouſneſs and Devotion. I never ſaw in any Quire of Monks or Prieſts in the Roman Church, that they ſung their Devotions with ſo much Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Abſtraction, as they ſpeak, as the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally here did. As ſoon as they were entred in their ſinging, they appear'd as if the whole Soul was engag'd, and elevated above the vain World, as if they were all Thought and Devotion. I confeſs it tranſported me with Pleaſure to ſee how fitly they ſung the Praiſes of the Great and Good Being. I thought my ſelf in Circumſtances that were a a pleaſant Emblem and Reſemblance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and bleſſed my ſelf, to find that I was now amidſt the pure Praiſes, and true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of God. And I conceiv'd ſuch a Diſdain and Deteſtation of the Worſhip of the Papiſts, where one ſees divine Honours paid to poor Creatures at the beſt, and ſome of them perhaps miſerable Sinners in Hell, that I could hardly perſwade my ſelf after this
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:94187:192"/> to look into any more of their Churches. This ſinging was twice interrupted for a little ſpace, at which times the Miniſter went from his Pew by the Pulpit, and ſtood before the Communion-Table, with his Face towards the People, and read firſt the Goſpel, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time the Epiſtle for the Day. After they had ſpent a good while in this pleaſant part of Worſhip, they ceaſed, and the Miniſter aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Pulpit, where he pray'd and preach'd. His Preaching was, as he told me afterwards, an Explication of the Goſpel for the Day. He perform'd his part with a great deal of Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Seriouſneſs, and with a very natural unaffected Zeal, which ſeem'd to demonſtrate him ſincerely ſenſible of what he ſaid. When he concluded, the People ſung again for a while, and then they were diſmiſs'd with a Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>In the Afternoon I had ſome Converſation with this Miniſter, in which he appear'd a very pious and good Man, and a judicious well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudied Divine, as I found afterwards. He has the Reputation of a good Scholar among the Proteſtant Divines. He was mightily pleasd to ſee a Prieſt of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in his Church, and in his Houſe, and expreſs'd a great Veneration and Eſteem for our Church He ask'd ſeveral important Queſtions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, and rejoyc'd at every thing I could tell him which look'd well, and in favour of it. He poſitively condemn'd thoſe of our Nation, who ſeparate ſo needleſsly from a Church ſo wiſely and juſtly reform'd, but he ſpoke this with a Spirit of Compaſſion and Tenderneſs becoming a Chriſtian; and he diſcover'd, that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:94187:192"/> he heartily lamented it, as a thing of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prejudice to the Progreſs and Proſperity of the Reformation. He told me they had many things wanting in their Aſſembly here, for want of Means, which are uſual among the Proteſtants, in other Places where they have more Encouragement. He had indeed a good Congregation, and many People appear'd there of good Faſhion. I obſerv'd ſome of the Electour's Guards there, in their Livery, both of the Horſe and Foot, who are <hi>Lutherans.</hi> But it cannot be ſo well with them as it ſhould be, under a Prince that inherits ſomething of a Bigottry for the abſurd and monſtrous Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he profeſſes. This Miniſter told me, that there are Five and twenty Congregations of Proteſtants in this Dutchy, beſides <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> Some of which, I think, enjoy a ſettled Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue for the Maintenance of the Miniſter, and publick Charges, but the moſt of them ſupply both theſe from their own immediate Contributions. He told me, the Churches of the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion have not all one Form of Liturgy every where exactly the ſame, nor all the ſame Modes or Methods of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Divine Offices, but in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they have their ſeveral Forms and Rites, yet they do not cenſure, or quarrel, or ſeparate from one another upon this ſcore, but he that is uſed to Methods of one ſort in one Country, when he comes into another joins with the Congregations, and conforms to the Methods there with the Spirit of Meekneſs, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Wiſdom; which was in the Primitive Chriſtians, and directed them to demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in like manner, in the like Caſes.</p>

               <p>Our Company happen'd to be all of the Reformed Religion, as they call the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in theſe Countries. They were glad when we told them we were Proteſtants, and we were very agreeable Company to each other. Some of them went with us quite to <hi>Emmerick,</hi> and were bound further. They were of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Natives and Inhabitants of the Dutchy of <hi>Mons.</hi> I asked them how they were uſed under the Popiſh Government here They ſhook their Heads, and ſighed, and ſignified that it is but very hardly; and intimated as much as amounted almoſt to Oppreſſion. I ſaid their Prince ſeem'd in his Perſon to be good and gentle, and to have no appearance of Fierceneſs in his Nature; they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd that, but ſaid his Confeſſour is a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, and by him and his Bretheren, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage this Prince too much, he is often inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do things which lie very hard and uneaſie upon the Proteſtants. The Truth is, thoſe
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:94187:193"/> good Men, the Jeſuites, are every where zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to extirpate the Reformation: And while the Biſhops and ſecular Clergy of the Roman Church, unleſs it be a few who are link'd to them; apply themſelves to the more humane and gentle Methods of perſwading and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to convert, as they call it, by ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repreſenting, and expounding the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Practices of their Church; Theſe, like true Politicks of the World endeavour and contrive nothing elſe but to oppreſs and deſtroy us. Their Buſineſs indeed is not to gain our Souls, but our Goods and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And to kill, and take Poſſeſſion, is their Means and their End. A glaring Proof of this they have to ſhew particularly in the large Territories, as we may call them, which they have long poſſeſs'd, of ruin'd Proteſtants in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Where ever they can manage a Power that is able to do Miſchief, they have procur'd the Exerciſe of the moſt Barbarous and Inhumane Cruelties againſt us that ever were.

And <hi>England</hi> was lately deſign'd to have been a horrid Scene of the ſame Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Barbarities; but, Heaven be prais'd, they were, for the preſent, diſappointed, by the timely Removal of the Tools which they had form'd and prepar'd for the Enterprize.</p>
               <p>The ſame People told me they came from a Place call'd <hi>Medman,</hi> within this Dutchy, <note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:94187:194"/> There, they ſaid, they had lately celebrated the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which they do four times in a Year: At which times People come from ſeveral Parts thither, for this purpoſe, and make up a Congregation of 1700 Communicants. They, poor People, are perhaps excuſable from their Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for the not uſing that Ordinance more frequently. But certainly where the Magiſtrate is of their Perſwaſion, and they might cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate it as often as they will, it is a thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe to put it off only to four times in a Year. Theſe People themſelves told me, that the moſt of the Proteſtant Congregations, even in thoſe Parts, do celebrate this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every Lord's Day. I cannot chuſe but think therefore, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>reform'd according to the Model of the beſt reform'd Churches beyond the Seas,</hi> which has provided, and perhaps order'd, that this Sacrament be celebrated every Lord's Day. But the Rule and Precept of Holy Scripture, together, and in conjunction, with the Practice and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe very Perſons, by whom the Spirit of God tranſmitted the Rule to the World, is certainly rather to be obſerv'd, than the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of any later Church; and our Rule in the caſe is certainly moſt agreeable with Holy Scriptures. I moſt heartily wiſh our People would, more generally than they do, fall in with ſo Juſt, and Pious, and Edifying an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. We ought indeed to relinquiſh and purge out more entirely from amongſt us this Relick of Popery; for it was the Papiſts who firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd, and betray'd the People into the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:94187:194"/> ſeldom Receiving of this Sacrament, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they now reproach us with it. They have taught the World, inſtead of receiving, to reverence it mightily firſt, and then by degrees to adore it. Certainly 'tis an Error, and a great one, to have ſuch an Awe and Reverence for the Sacrament it ſelf, as to have none at all for the Ordinance or Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it, which requires it to be receiv'd. And it is doubtleſs a wrong and ſuperſtitious Fear, to be afraid of receiving it unworthily, and not be afraid of neglecting and omitting to receive it as often as we might have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do ſo.</p>
               <p>Our Road from <hi>Duſſeldorp</hi> was not on the Bank of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but out of the Sight of it. We paſs'd through a rich Corn Country, and our Ways were tolerably good. When we came within about two Hours of <hi>Duysberg,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wood of</hi> Duysberg.</note> which was to be about the middle of this Day's Journey, we entred a vaſt Wood or Foreſt. It was very pleaſant to us, and look'd almoſt every where like a Grove, there being very little under-wood within our Sight, and it was generally dry and firm under us. It is full of ſtately tall Trees, the moſt of them Beech or Oak, and they very fair and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. There was on it a good Coat of Green, which afforded Paſture for Sheep; and we ſaw in our way three or four very large Flocks of Sheep of a good ſize, they look'd in a very good Condition, and were each Flock attended with two or three Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and ſo many ſtout Dogs; and beſides they kept near together. This Wood is ſaid
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:94187:195"/> to have a great many wild Beaſts in it, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts, and to have beſides many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Horſes that run wild in it, who chuſe a hungry Liberty, eſpecially in Winter, rather than a fat and well fed Servitude. There were Juniper Buſhes ſcatter'd about every where through this Wood in great abundance. We were about an Hour and half in paſſing through it, at a good rate of travelling, and found it thick ſet with Trees all the way; and when we came on the other ſide of it, where we look'd upon <hi>Duysburg,</hi> we obſerv'd that it ſurrounded the City at the diſtance of two or three Miles, and went both ways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our Sight, though we could ſee it a great way.</p>
               <p>We had left the Dutchy of <hi>Mons,</hi> and were entred the Dutchy of <hi>Cleve</hi> ſome little time <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Duysberg</hi> was the firſt City we came to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">Ouysberg.</note> the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg</hi>'s Dominions. We reach'd it about half an Hour after we came out of the Wood. It is a wall'd City, but very ſmall, and the Houſes are mean. It ſeems a poor Place, and to have no Buſineſs or Trade. It ſtands at the diſtance of about Two Mile from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> on the River <hi>Roer.</hi> It has Two Pariſh Churches in it, which are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large ones. Theſe are poſſeſs'd, and us'd by thoſe of the Reformed Religion, as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy of the Town are of that way. In walking about it I ſaw no where any publick Marks of Popery, in Croſſes or Images, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Streets. But the Papiſts have here the full Liberty of the Exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in Publick, and there are ſeveral of thoſe call'd Religious Houſes of theirs in the City.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:94187:196"/> There is a ſmall Univerſity in this City, of the Reform'd Religion, for the Studies of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and Divinity. I ſaw about half a Dozen young Men ſtragling about in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with a Book under their Arms. The Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents here have Liberty to Hunt in the Wood of <hi>Duysberg,</hi> and by the Mien of thoſe we ſaw, one would take them to be rather Animals of the Foreſt, than Students in an Univerſity. There are, they ſay, at preſent Two hundred Students here. One <hi>Hulſius</hi> is the Profeſſour of Divinity. I ſaw in a ſmall Bookſellers Hands a little ſort of a Syſtem of Divinity, which he has written. Our Foreman would ſtay here but a very little while, ſo we had not Opportunity to converſe with any one.</p>
               <p>Soon after we were out of the City, we were to croſs the <hi>Roer.</hi> This is the ſecond River of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>River</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> that Name we met with in our Journey; the former was at <hi>Juliers,</hi> which runs into the <hi>Maeſe.</hi> This River comes from the Dutchy of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> runs through the County of <hi>Marck,</hi> and falls into the <hi>Rhine</hi> a little below this City. We croſs'd this River in a good commodious Ferry-Boat. It was very broad now, but had been much broader a little before with the Rains. It claims a good ſpace on each ſide the common Channel here, to uſe upon Occaſion, and has taken Poſſeſſion of it with Sand and Gravel. I could not obſerve, or learn that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Veſſels, with any manner of Trade, do come up this River from the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we had paſs'd the River, we found our Way in a low Country, and very wet and dirty all along to <hi>Dijnſlaeken,</hi> where our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Dijnſlae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kene</note>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:94187:197"/> would lodge us that Night. This is reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned one of the Cities of the Dutchy of <hi>Cleve,</hi> but is the pooreſt, vileſt Place that ever I ſaw in my Life. We came to it through a long Lane, full of Water; at the bottom of the Water were laid the Bodies of Trees, as cloſe to each other as they could lie, and which reach'd croſs the Lane. This is a ſort of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, abſolutely neceſſary to the Wetneſs and Rottenneſs of the Ground here. We jolted over theſe Trees for I believe near half a Mile together. At length we came to a pitiful old and ruinous Wall, which ſurrounds the City. As we enter'd, we ſaw within the City, on our Left Hand, Three tall Crucifixes, ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a raiſed Ground, and by them a little Brick Building, like thoſe Chappels or O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>atories to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which we ſaw ſometimes in the Fields; and this had in it an Altar and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of ſome ſort or other. The prevailing Religion then of this City, we may ſuppoſe to be the Popiſh. I did not ask whether they have any Religious Houſes here, for it were unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe that there are. It would be true Mortification to thoſe People to live in ſo miſerable a Place, therefore they would all be ſure to avoid it. We came in too late to ſee the Church, but could expect to ſee nothing worth obſerving if we had been earlier. There was a large Brook running through the Town with ſome Force and Noiſe; over it lay a wretched wooden Bridge, which ſeem'd broad enough for Carts to go upon, but too rotten to bear them. We went over it with ſome Care and Fear' The Water of this was of a lovely
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:94187:197"/> Cheſnut Colour, which ſhows from what ſort of Ground it is deriv'd. Yet from a Well in the Town I got tolerable good Water to drink. I reckon indeed that the Town it ſelf ſtands upon firm Ground, but at the edge of a Tract of marſhy Ground, and it is on that ſide of the mooriſh Ground which is towards the <hi>Rhine.</hi> It is not, I believe, far from that River, and, I ſuppoſe, the Ground between them to be more firm and paſſable. I believe the Occaſion and Original of the Town to have been at firſt a Roman Fort, which is a uſual thing in all the Countries conquer'd by that brave People. For there remains here a very remarkable Building, <note place="margin">Raman Building.</note> concerning which I could learn nothing, but that it was built by them about the time of our Saviour's Nativity. It is a large and high Tower, built perfectly round. It ſtands, with the Building adjoined, in a Place a little eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the reſt of the Town. It is at one Corner of a large ſquare Court, about which is a great Brick Building, like the common Seats of the Barons of theſe Countries, which are commonly call'd Caſtles. Several of which we met with in our Journey, and after the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of ſome of our old Mannours in <hi>England;</hi> and the whole is encompaſs'd by a broad deep Moat, which was almoſt big enough to have ſerv'd for a Town Ditch. We may ſay it is deep, becauſe it was of a great dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> From the top to the Water that was in it The Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Tower, down to the Water, and ſomewhat above Ground, was made of great ſquare Free-Stone; above this, all the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is Brick. I do not remember that I ſaw
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94187:198"/> any where in the Wall, on the outſide of the Court, any Places to let in Light, or from whence any could look out. It is built very high, but in Three Parts. The loweſt part goes up, of an equal bigneſs, to about the height of Three or Four good Stories; round the top of that there ſeem'd to be a Battlement. The ſecond part, above this, is ſomewhat leſs than this lower one, and ſtands as within it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. That alſo, like the firſt, goes up all of a bigneſs, and ſeems as tall as the lower, and to have a Battlement at the top. The third, and higheſt part, is ſet a little within the ſecond, ſeems not ſo tall as the other, and has Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the top. The whole Building ſeem'd compleat and ſound, and had no appearance of any ruine or decay about it. The Building about the Court look'd decay'd. We purpoſed, it being now almoſt dark, to come the next Morning and examine it a little further; but our Foreman hurried us away very early, and ſo diſappointed us. From the Circumſtances of the Place, I judge this muſt have been a Watch-Tower, or a ſort of Caſtle to view and command here a conſiderable Paſs between it and the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We left this wretched Place betimes in the Morning, on the 3d. <hi>June,</hi> and paſs'd on for <hi>Emmerick.</hi> The firſt part of our Journey, for about an Hour and a half, was over a vaſt wet mooriſh Common; there were ſome Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle feeding in it, here and there, up to the mid-leg in Water, and it ſeem'd, that the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Water ſtood ſo, were the beſt for them, for theſe look'd the greeneſt. Our
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:94187:198"/> Path through it was ſunk a little below the reſt ſometimes, and then full of Water. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we left this Common, our Way was but indifferent till we had paſs'd about Two Thirds of our Journey towards <hi>Weſel,</hi> and then we had a dry Way, upon ſome Downs. When we came to the River <hi>Lippe,</hi> that and the <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Rhine</hi> were ſo ſwell'd with Rains, that we could not uſe the ordinary Ferry here, nor go the direct and uſual Way to <hi>Weſel.</hi> We waited a great while therefore for a <hi>Naken,</hi> which could carry us where the Ferry-Boat could not, and which was on the other ſide the <hi>Lippe,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a quarter of a Mile above our Place. When that was come, we hung our Charrette at one end of it, ſtow'd our Two Horſes, and above a Dozen People in it, and mounted the Stream of <hi>Lippe,</hi> which was now very broad, till we came to the convenient landing Place, This River, call'd by <hi>Tacitus, Luppia,</hi> comes down from the Dutchy of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> where it has upon it the City of <hi>Lipstadt.</hi> It falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> on the right ſide. We had near an Engliſh Mile to go, from the Place where we landed of this River to <hi>Weſel.</hi> It is, they ſay, navigable a great way up into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weſel,</hi> call'd in Latin <hi>Veſalia,</hi> is one of <note place="margin">Weſel.</note> the chief Cities in the Dutchy of <hi>Cleve.</hi> It ſtands upon the right Bank of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the more convenient for Trade, by reaſon of the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Lippe,</hi> which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable up into the Country. This City has been ſeveral times taken and retaken, between the Armies of the Spaniards, and of the States
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:94187:199"/> General. At laſt, <hi>Frederick Henry,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Commander of the Armies of the States, took it by Stratagem and Surpiſe, in the Year 1629, in the Quarrel between the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> fore-mention'd. It remain'd, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Cities, in the Dutchy of <hi>Cleve,</hi> in the Poſſeſſion of the States, as a Pawn for Money lent the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> in that War. And being thus as it were between Two Maſters, it was not ſo well look'd to, or provided for, as it ſhould have been, and ſo was eaſily taken by the French, in the Year 1672, when they made their ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Invaſion into <hi>Holland.</hi> But this, with the other Cities, were reſtor'd to the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> ſince which time it has remain'd under that Prince. And now it ſeems better look'd too. As we enter'd into it, we obſerv'd a good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification about it. There is a good Garriſon of Soldiers in it, they examin'd us ſtrictly at the Gate, what we were, and whither we were bound. The Streets are fair and large, the Houſes well built, much after the <hi>Holland</hi> Faſhion. There appear'd in it abundance of Shops, and they plentifully ſtor'd with all ſorts of Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Many People were paſſing in the Streets, and every thing look'd in a good Condition, ſo that in general it ſeems at preſent to be rich, populous, and flouriſhing. It ſeems to be chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited by thoſe of the Reform'd Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We paſſed through a great part of it, and ſaw no where any Marks of the Romiſh Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtion in publick. Yet the Papiſts have here
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:94187:199"/> ſome of thoſe they call Religious Houſes, and this is a pleaſant and convenient Place for them. We did not ſtay here but juſt long enough to eat a little Breakfaſt which we needed the more, for having travell'd this Morning three or four Hours, and for being diſappointed of a Supper the Night before, by reaſon of the Naſtineſs of the Proviſion that had been made for us; ſo we had no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to view much, or make any Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries concerning this Place.</p>
               <p>Our Way from hence was through a low, <note place="margin">A Dyke on the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
                  </note> rich Country, all encloſed and uſed: The big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger half of our Way to <hi>Emmerick</hi> was upon a high-rais'd Cauſway, which runs along this part of the Country at ſome Places at a good Diſtance from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> at ſome places juſt upon it. We came upon it about an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we came to <hi>Rees.</hi> For the moſt part, as we paſs'd this Dyke, we had a great deal of Water on our left Hand, which was from the Swelling of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which at this time co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, along here, ſome thouſands of Acres of good Land, ſome Meadows, and ſome plough'd Ground. In ſome places it came to the very Dyke, ſo deep, that it left nothing but the Tops of the Willows, which run along by the Diviſions of the Meadows, to be ſeen: And at the ſame time, we were ſo far off the Channel, that we could not ſee any thing like it: Oftentimes we found the Land within the Dyke, on our right Hand, full of Water too, it being a low Country, but ſuch, as that a great deal of it was plough'd and ſown, tho', <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:94187:200"/> this Year. This Dyke was, for the moſt part, too narrow for two of our little Charrettes to go abreſt, but ſome places were made broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where, if any met, they might paſs by one another, and they could ſee one another at a Diſtance, ſo that the firſt that came, ſtaid till the other was paſs'd by. The bad Weather was the Occaſion that the Road upon the Dyke was a little broken, and the Tracks of the Wheels ſometimes deep on one ſide, and ſometimes on the other, and there was no choice of Way, by reaſon it was ſo narrow. This put our Driver to a great deal of Care, and us in a ſeeming Danger of being often tumbled over; in which Caſe we muſt of Neceſſity have tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled down the Dyke, and have hazarded ſome Limbs where we had fall'n dry, or drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning if we had fallen into the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The River, I ſaid, waſhes this Dyke in ſome places, and that it may not waſh it away, the Country People fortifie it with wattled Boughs and Buſhes ſtak'd down upon the Ground. We did not go into <hi>Rees,</hi> but our Foreman baited his Horſe at a Place near it, where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd our ſelves with a Glaſs of extraordinary good Mum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rees</hi> appear'd to us a little City well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. <note place="margin">Rees.</note> This ſort of Way laſted with us to <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> and by Reaſon of our ſlow and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful going upon it, I believe it took us up four or five Hours. We were glad, and thankful to the good Providence of God, when we came to <hi>Emmerick,</hi> that we were got ſafe and without any ill Accident through ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Danger.</p>

                  <hi>Emmerick,</hi> commonly call'd by the People of <note place="margin">Emmerick.</note> the Country, <hi>Embrick;</hi> by the <hi>Latines, Embrica, Emmerica,</hi> and <hi>Emmeriacum,</hi> is one of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Cities in the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves:</hi> This has followed the Fate of <hi>Weſel,</hi> and is alſo now in the Poſſeſſion of the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> It is a large City, but ſeems not to be ſo big as <hi>Weſel,</hi> nor in ſo flouriſhing a Condition: It ſtands on the <hi>Rhine</hi> too, on the right Side. There were but few People that appear'd here in the Streets, and it ſeems to have no great Trade or Buſineſs. There was a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate Church founded here by S. <hi>Willibroerd,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> about the Year of our Lord, 700; whether it remains ſuch ſtill, or not, I was not inform'd. But the two Pariſh-Churches of the Town are both in the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Papiſts; beſides which, they have alſo here ſix or ſeven Churches belonging to Religious Houſes. The Jeſuits have here a College and a great School, and are very rich; I came too late to viſit them, and was now haſtening homewards. The Magiſtrates of this City, under the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> are of the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Sort. Theſe have, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I was told, but one Place of Worſhip: It is indeed too little for them, and therefore they are about building a larger. The Walls and Cover of it are up: It is a large, ſquare, Brick Building. The Proteſtants alſo have here one good Congregation, and a Publick Toleration and Place of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>We were reſolved to go from hence to <hi>Cleve,</hi> but were told it would be a Trouble and exceſſive Charge to go with a Charrette, becauſe
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:94187:201"/> we ſhould have two broad Waters to paſs over, and the Road was not very good. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd then what a ſort of Foot-path there might be thither, for we were by this time well aweary of the ſorry Charrettes we had been ſo much in, and this they ſaid would be but a Walk of two Hours. They told us the Foot-path was very good, therefore we hir'd a ſturdy Fellow, for a Guilder, to carry our Portmantle, and reſolv'd to walk it: We ſet out about ſix a clock in the Morning from <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick.</hi> At the Walls of the Town we took a Boat to croſs the <hi>Rhine.</hi> It was a large and deep Boat, and I believe contriv'd to bear a little Toſſing, which it muſt needs be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times liable to, by a Reaſon of the great Breadth of the River here. We were ſo early, that we had very few Paſſengers with us, and no Horſe nor Charrette. By the help of a large Sail, and a ſmall Gale of Wind, we croſs'd the broad River in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time. Our Way was ſometimes overflow'd with Water, and we were forc'd to go about. At the Middle of our Walk, we were come to the ſecond Water we had to paſs, which, as it was now ſwell'd, ſeem'd as broad at leaſt as the Channel of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> This is ordinarily no very broad Channel; it comes out of the <hi>Rhine</hi> at ſome Diſtance above <hi>Emmerick</hi> on the left Side the River, and goes into it again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, near <hi>Griethuyſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:94187:201"/> and Horſes, and a Charrette at one end of it, ſo that it ſunk almoſt to the Brim. We were convey'd a good Way among Orcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is certainly a very ancient City, and was perhaps firſt built and inhabited by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, who gave it the Name it has from its Situation. 'Tis very probable it might begin with a Caſtle, or Fort, as many Cities have done, and the Tradition of the Place is, that a Caſtle was built here by <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> The City is call'd <hi>Cleve</hi> by the French, and <hi>Cleef</hi> by the Inhabitants, and both theſe Names are evidently deriv'd from the Latin Words, <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> or <hi>Clivia,</hi> which ſignifie the ſteep ſide of a Hill, and ſuch there is great deal of here. The preſent Caſtle, which they ſay is upon the Place where that of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was built, and where they pretend to ſhow ſome Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Building, ſtands juſt upon the Brink of a deep Precipice. From thence the Hill deſcends more gradually, another way, to a little River which runs by the City, and falls into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> not far below it, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries good large Boats for Goods or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſſengers, to and from the <hi>Rhine.</hi> On this gradual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the loweſt Hill, and partly up the ſide
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:94187:202"/> of another above it, the City is built. It is but a ſmall City, but is well peopled, being a very pleaſant and healthy Situation; and though it is not the biggeſt, it is nevertheleſs the chief City of the Province It gives the Name to the whole Dutchy of <hi>Cleef,</hi> and has been the uſual Seat and Reſidence of the Sovereign of this and ſome Neighbouring Provinces. It is encompaſs'd with a Wall, but it ſeems that it cannot well be made defenſible, by Reaſon of the Hill that lies over it. It ſtands very airy, and has its Streets of a good breadth. Our Lodging was in a handſome Street, near the Reform'd or <hi>Calvin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi> Church. This is a lofty and large Brick Building. We did not go into it, having ſeen enough of the manner of thoſe Churches in <hi>Holland,</hi> and we were not told of any thing worth our Obſervation there. But from our Lodging our way in aſcending towards the Caſtle, was through a large Stone Building, which ſtands acroſs that Street, which they call the middle Port. This is pretended to have been built by <hi>Eumenius Rhetor,</hi> who was the Roman Governour over the Gauls here. This is ſaid by an Inſcription on the upper ſide of the Gate, but there is no Date added to expreſs the time of this. Over the Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtands, carv'd in the Stone the Effigies of this <hi>Eumenius.</hi> His Habit is cloſe to his Body, down to his Waſte; from thence it hangs looſe, in Folds, to his Feet. The Sleeves of it are alſo cloſe to his Arms, and reach to his Wriſts. He has a Ferula in his Left Hand, which was a Symbol of Authority, and in his Right
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:94187:202"/> Hand he holds up a little Diſh, which ſeems heap'd full with Pieces of Gold.</p>
               <p>From hence we ſtill aſcended very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to the Caſtle. This is a very large Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caſtle of</hi> Cleve.</note> and poſſeſſes a great deal of Ground. We were told, it contains, of all ſorts, at leaſt Three hundred and fifty Rooms. We ſaw the beſt of them, which did not amount to twenty. The Audience-Chamber, the Dining-Room, the Bed-Chamber belonging to the Electour, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d ſeveral others. The fineſt Rooms which they ſhow'd us, they call'd our King's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; theſe were his Bed-Chamber, and his Audience-Chamber. The outward Curtains of the Bed were blew Velvet, the inward were white Satin, curiouſly embroider'd with Silk, with a Cover-lid, and the top of the Bed of the ſame. Here were the livelieſt and the beſt Tapeſtry Hangings that I ever ſaw. One Piece repreſented a Winter, where one ſees a Gentleman driving his Miſtreſs in a Traino, and others skateing upon the Ice. In another there is a Feaſt; in another a Landſchape, with Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, making merry by their Flocks. All the Figures on theſe were ſo lively, and ſo well ſhaded and proportion'd, that it does not ſeem eaſie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel them in a Picture. The next Room to this is his Majeſty's Audience-Chamber, which is hung with excellent Tapeſtry too. The State is Scarlet Velvet; the Seams where the ſeveral Breadths of the Velvet are join'd, are cover'd with a broad Gold Galoone. The Fringe round the Canopy, conſiſted of a multitude of little Knots of Gold Thread, tied up in a great
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:94187:203"/> Number of Bows. The Curtains, over the Doors, were of the ſame Velvet, with a Gold Galoon, and ſuch Knots round at the Edge of them. In theſe, and the other beſt Rooms of the Caſtle, we were divided between the Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Furniture within, and the Beauty of the Proſpects out at the Windows. Below are Gardens belonging to the Caſtle, and beyond them one looks either towards the Hill above the City, which is planted with Trees, that ſtand in Rows up to the top, from the View of the Caſtle, or elſe one ſees a great length of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> with the Country about it. From theſe Chambers we deſcended a little; and went through a long Gallery, and at length, under a wide Arch, we went down ſome Steps into a great Hall. This Arch is of Marble, of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Colours, and the ſeveral Ranges of it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally wrought. It ſeems to be old Work, but intelligent People ſay, it is not ſo old as is pretended. For this was ſhown us as a Relick of the old Building of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> On one ſide of it there ſtands a little Image, in a Niche, much defaced, which ſeems to be juſt of the ſame Figure with that on the Gate fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, and, I believe, was made for the ſame <hi>Eumenius;</hi> but the People told us, this is the Effigies of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> himſelf, and over it, accordingly, there is this Inſcription in the Wall:
:
<q>Anno Urbe Romana condita, Sexcentiſſimo Nonageſſimo Octavo, Caius Julius Caeſar, Dictator hiſce partibus in deditionem redactis arcem Clivenſem aedificavit.</q>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:94187:203"/> Which tells, that in the Year 698, after the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was built, <hi>Caius Julius Caeſar,</hi> the Dictatour, built the Caſtle of <hi>Cleve,</hi> after he had brought theſe Parts of the Country in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Subjection to the Roman People.</p>
               <p>There are many very pleaſant Sights about the City of <hi>Cleve,</hi> ſuch as Fountains, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Walks planted with Trees, the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Linden, Boom, or Lime Tree, one of the faireſt in the World. And indeed I never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where ſaw this kind of Trees ſo fair and beautiful as they are here. The Place ſeems to be peculiarly agreeable to them. It were too long a Task to mention every thing particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that is entertaining here, but I muſt not omit the fineſt Proſpect perhaps in the World, which they have from the top of the Hill, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the City, which they call <hi>Sterrenberg.</hi> We <note place="margin">Sterren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Among the Trees planted here, there are left Thirteen Alleys, which run ſtrait down the Hill, and meet all in the Center at the top. From thence theſe Alleys point and direct the view to ſome conſiderable Place in the Country round about. And one ſees all the beautiful Country round, as far as the Eye can reach with a diſtinct View, from <hi>Nimmeguen</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to <hi>Weſel</hi> upwards, with all the Valley upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the Cities and Villages in that,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:94187:204"/> and upon the Hills which bound the Sight on the other ſide. A finer Country cannot be ſeen, and the Proſpect is as much as the Eye can reach; ſo that if any where in the World an Exception could be found to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Maxim, it is here, that the Eye muſt be ſatisfied with ſeeing. At the bottom of this Hill, where it ſtands as it were in Two Stories, almoſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and ſhows its ſelf from the bottom to the top, cover'd with Trees that ſeem to hang over our Heads, the Electour has choſen a Place to make ſome new Water-Works. The Hill there affords a plentiful Spring of Water for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. There are but Two of the Deſigns fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd. In one of them the Water was drove up, form'd into the Shape of a huge taper'd Drinking-Glaſs; the Cavity is big enough, if it were a Glaſs, to hold, I believe, a Gallon of good Liquour, and ſo affords a Speculation ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable to a German Soul. At another Place the Water comes up through a Pipe, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quick, and raiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As one enters this Place, there ſtands an Obelisk of Stone; on the Pedeſtal are laid five great Globes of Stone, and upon them the tall Pillar ſtands. At the top of this is an Effigies of Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> of poliſh'd Steel. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this great Man is very freſh, and much honour'd here, and we ſhall have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to ſay of him anon.</p>
               <p>In this City, the Magiſtracy, under the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> are of the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> ſort; but he tolerates every other ſort of Religion
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:94187:204"/> here, with the Indifferency of the Dutch in that matter. The Anabaptiſts have a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation here. The Proteſtants have a good large Church, encompaſs'd with a Church-Yard; but the Papiſts are a great Proportion of the People of the City. They are in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the great Church, as 'tis call'd, and of the Revenues belonging to it. This ſtands high, and is viſible long before one comes to the City, by two Turrets at the Weſt end of it. This is a Collegiate Church, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about fifteen Chanoines. The Perſon that ſhow'd it us, ſaid they poſſeſs all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue that they ever had, but it is but ſmall. We ſaw nothing fine in the Church, but all was in a pretty good Condition. There are two large Monuments of Dukes of <hi>Cleve,</hi> which contain them and their Dutcheſſes, and their Children, but are very naked and plain. Here they pretend to have the Relicks of ſome of the famous Companions of St. <hi>Urſula,</hi> who <note place="margin">

I ſaw in his Houſe a Picture in black and white, of <hi>Martin Luther;</hi> it repreſented him with a fuller Face than I had ſeen before, but he ſaid it was very exactly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from a Picture of him, which had been drawn from the Life, in the Country where he liv'd. It was all done with a Pen, and is no bigger then might be cover'd with a little Hand. That which ſeem'd moſt curious in it, is a ſmall Writing in High Dutch Language, but in Latin Letters, ſo curiouſly laid about it, that ſome very artificially makes the Folds of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:94187:206"/> his Gown; ſome is turn'd about upon his Head and makes a Buſh of curl'd Hair, and two Lines over each Eye form his Eye-brows. The Writing contains ſeveral remarkable Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Life. As the Picture hung up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wall, tho' but at a little Diſtance, I could not perceive that any of this was Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but when it was in my Hand, I could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Letters plainly, and ſpell the Words. I went into his Church, which is a good large one, and will hold a multitude of People, yet by the Encreaſe of his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are forc'd to enlarge their Room. The Communion-Table ſtood here upon an Aſcent of one Step at the Eaſt End of the Church. The Book of Liturgy was upon it, and is uſed there: I ſaw it contain'd their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs and Pſalms, and Forms of Prayer. Over it, againſt the Wall, was ſomewhat a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Picture repreſenting the Benefit which good Men received by the Blood of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Coming, as well as in the Times of the Goſpel. It might be ſaid to be an Emblem of that Text, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> Here again I underſtood that the Rites and Methods of Adminiſtring the Publick Worſhip in the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are different in ſeveral Provinces and Countries; yet <hi>Lutherans</hi> wherever they come join with <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and ſcruple not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to what they find practiſed in ſuch indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Matters.</p>
               <p>We were told of a ſmall Collection of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Antiquities at a Place call'd <hi>Bergendale,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Mile from the City; we went to it in
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:94187:206"/> the Way to <hi>Zante,</hi> upon the Hill, being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the Pleaſantneſs of it. For it is planted with Lime-Trees on both Sides, and tho' it is broad enough for more than two Coaches to go abreaſt in it, yet the Trees mingle their Boughs over Head from both Sides, and make a thick Covert all the way. We walk'd in this Way a good while, and were told it continues ſuch for the length of three Miles ſtrait from the City, then it turns a little, and is planted on both Sides with Firr-Trees, and ſo goes on to <hi>Zante.</hi> When we left it to go for <hi>Bergendale</hi> we were ſtill, all the way entertain'd with the Pleaſure of Plantations of Trees in Rows, ſometimes of one ſort, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of another. <hi>Bergendale</hi> is a Place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable <note place="margin">Bergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale.</note> to the Name of it, which ſignifies <hi>a Valley in a Hill:</hi> For it is a ſmall Fall of the Ground of the Compaſs but of a few Acres ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with the riſing of the Hill, which ſtands up about it, I believe almoſt as high as the Tops of the tall Trees that are planted in it; theſe ſtand pretty thick in it, and make it a pleaſant Grove. This Place Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> whom the People call Stadtholder of <hi>Cleve,</hi> choſe for a Country Retirement. He was Governour of this Dutchy, and ſome of the Neighbouring Provinces, under the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> He has built here a little Timber Houſe, I think, with only ſeveral ſmall Ground-Rooms; It is Weather-boarded on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and altogether plain and without Finery within: But this Perſon was the Man who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd and beautified the City of <hi>Cleve</hi> with all thoſe Plantations of Trees which make the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:94187:207"/> Place ſo extreamly pleaſant. He has built here a thick Stone Wall which ſtands as a Segment of a Circle, and in it are faſtned ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Roman</hi> Urns and Inſcriptions; ſeveral of theſe were found at <hi>Zante,</hi> or other Places of this Dutchy, and ſuch things are often found hereabouts; a certain Demonſtration that the <hi>Romans</hi> had a conſiderable Settlement here.</p>
               <p>The Urns are moſt of them ſomewhat bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns.</note> and appear to have been but thin Pots, they are all Earthen ones, and of ſeveral Shapes, ſome long and ſlender, ſome ſhort and broad, in Proportion. There was, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nothing in them at preſent. To fulfil the propoſed End of this Account, I ſhall here inſert the Uſe which the <hi>Romans</hi> made of theſe things for the Entertainment of thoſe to whom it may be unknown. When they fell into the Cuſtom of Burning their Dead Bodies, they perform'd it after the following Manner. When the Dead Body had been for ſeven whole days together waſh'd, anointed, and call'd to, by the neareſt of Kin, at length, with ſolemn Pomp, it was carried out to the Burning. The Pile of Wood was built in Form of an Altar, and ſweet-ſmelling Woods were mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, that the Smell of the Body in Burning might not offend the Company. The Dead Body was laid upon the Pile with the Face upwards, a Piece of Money was put into the Mouth to pay <hi>Charon,</hi> the ſuppoſed Ferry-man of the <hi>Stygian Lake,</hi> who was to conduct his Soul over that to the <hi>Elyſian Fields,</hi> or Place of Bliſs. And they thought the Soul
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:94187:207"/> ſtill remain'd with the Body, even after Death, till the Body was diſſolv'd. When they had done this, the neareſt of Kin took a lighted Torch, and, with the Face turn'd away, ſet Fire to the Pile; ſometimes precious Liquors, as rich Wines, or perfum'd Oils, were thrown upon the Fire as it was burning, and ſometimes rich Cloaths, and Gold, or Silver, were thrown into the Flames when any Great Perſon was burn'd, and the Cuſtom grew to an Exceſs, which the Government thought fit to reſtrain by a Law. While the Fire laſted, ſome of their Slaves were kill'd, or Captives taken in War, at the burning of a Commander; or elſe hir'd Gladiatours fought and blooded one the other, as a Sacrifice and Attonement to the Infernal Gods. When the Wood was all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd and the Body, the ſame Perſon that lighted the Pile gathered up the Aſhes of the Body which remain'd, and any bits of Bones that were not burnt; and, having firſt waſh'd them with Milk and Wine, put them into theſe Urns. After which, this Perſon and the reſt of the Company were three times ſprinkled by the Prieſt with clean Water: The Perſon that lighted the Fire, gave the Word, that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might depart, and they, in departing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced mournfully and aloud, the Word <hi>Farewel,</hi> to which they commonly added this, moreover, <hi>In the Order which Nature permits we ſhall follow thee.</hi> The Urn, with the Aſhes in it, was buried, and an Altar was erected by the Place of Burial.</p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:94187:208"/>
               <p>On that Altar, which was as it were a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chral Monument, there was an Inſcription <note place="margin">Roman In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.</note> expreſſing who the Perſon was whoſe Aſhes were there buried. Over the Inſcription they commonly ſet theſe Words, <hi>Diis Manibus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi> or elſe the firſt Letters only for them, as <hi>D. M.</hi> or <hi>D. M. S.</hi> And ſome of the Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here ſeen, appear by this to have belong'd to Sepulchres. The Meaning of this was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, according to the different Opinion which they had that built theſe Monuments. Some by their <hi>Manes</hi> meant <hi>Pluto,</hi> and the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Gods, to whom they hereby recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Souls of the Dead. Others call'd the very Souls of the Dead, <hi>Manes,</hi> and reckon'd that they became of the Number of thoſe Gods, and ſo they erected theſe Altars as an Honour to them. There are ſeveral Stones faſtned in the Wall fore-mention'd, with Inſcriptions upon them, which ſignified that ſome of them belong'd to the Altars of the Romans, and ſome to their Sepulchral Monuments. On ſome of theſe I ſaw the Letters, <hi>D. M. S.</hi> On one, theſe words at length, <hi>Dijs Manibus,</hi> the word <hi>Sacrum</hi> for Holy being underſtood. Of one Inſcription I made out thus much,

               <p>In this Valley of <hi>Bergendale</hi> ſtands a vaſt Tomb, the biggeſt that I ever ſaw. It is all of it Iron, and encloſes the Body of the Great Man who made this Collection.

               <p>Returning from hence, we went a lower way, through the Meadows, to the City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and had all along a near view of the ſteep Cliff which gives name to the Place.

He ſhow'd us a Gold Medal of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of an Oval Form, which commemorated our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the Spaniſh Invaſion, deſign'd in 1588. Several other ancient and modern ones we ſaw, but while we were very buſie in this pleaſing Entertainment, ſome good Women of his Acquaintance came in a Coach, and call'd him out, whom we thought at that time very impertinent.

               <head>Paſſage from <hi>Nimmeguen</hi> to <hi>Rotterdam.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE next Day we took the Ship which went for <hi>Rotterdam</hi> at Eight a Clock in the Morning. It was very full of Paſſengers. We paid for each Perſon one Guilder two Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers for our Paſſage; and at going off they ſpung'd ſomething of us for our Portmantle, and for the Ship Servants. We could not be in the Roof, the moſt commodious Room in the Ship, becauſe there was one of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> with ſome of his Family in it, and though they did not fill it, yet they would poſſeſs it all; and when we found every Body elſe gave way to his Worſhip, with the Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to a Petty Prince, we were forced to do ſo too, and ſtow'd our ſelves but inconveniently in the Skipper's Kitchin. For it was a Day of exceſſive Rain, and forced us to be under cover. We paid four times Paſſage Money between this and <hi>Dort.</hi> At <hi>Nimmeguen</hi> a Stiver for each Perſon; at <hi>Tiel</hi> a Stiver and half; at <hi>Bommel</hi> two Stivers; at <hi>Gorcum</hi> two Stivers, and an O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tie, that is a quarter of a Stiver. We were forced, at each of the three laſt mention'd Places, to ſtop till an Officer came on board us to gather this, and this ſtay loſt us uſually almoſt an Hour. We had a Gale of Wind, but it was directly againſt us, at North Weſt. This made our Way long, by Reaſon of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Tacks it forced us to make. Towards Night it fail'd us, and we could advance no
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:94187:213"/> faſter, than as the Stream drove us, yet we got down before Ten a Clock at Night to <hi>Dort.</hi> The Tide gave us little or no Hindrance, becauſe at this time it did not come up ſo far as uſually, eſpecially with a Weſterly Wind, by Reaſon of the great Force of the River, which was exceedingly ſwell'd with the great Rains, and Land-Floods. In a dry Seaſon, with ſuch a Wind, we were told the Tide will mount to <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rcum,</hi> or beyond, whereas now it came not ſo high. On this Occaſion I ſhall take notice of what I have obſerv'd and learnt concerning the lowneſs of this Province of <hi>Holland.</hi> The Rain and Snow which falls in the Winter-time, lies upon their Ground, and covers all their Meadows all over the Country with Water, ſo that the whole Country looks like a Sea, and no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y Ground appears, but here and there, where a Village or a City ſtands a little above the Water, and where there are high raiſed Banks, which they call Dykes, to go upon between them. This Water muſt in Spring-time be all thrown out of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows by Mills. Theſe throw it into the great Canals, which are the uſual Paſſages about the Country. Theſe Canals communicate with the Rivers by Sluces, which are open'd at a low Tide, and then the Water which they are fill'd with from the Meadows, will ſome of it fall off. But if there be at the time of dreining a weſterly Wind, eſpecially a ſtrong one. It keeps the Waters of the Rivers ſo high, that the Canals will not empty themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rivers at all, or but very little, at the loweſt of the Tide. For this Reaſon, when
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:94187:213"/> there is a weſterly Wind, the Mills are bound to obſerve a Water Mark. And when the Canal which they throw the Water into is riſen to that Mark, they muſt ſtop, and and work no more till it is ſunk below it again. But if there be a good eaſterly Wind, that drives the Waters of the Rivers ſo much out, that the Mills are not bound to obſerve their Mark, becauſe every fall of the Tide will let out Water enough to empty the Canals ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; but at ſuch a time I have ſeen the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Brim full, by that time the Tide would give leave to open the Sluces, and let the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out.</p>
               <p>Somewhat above <hi>Gorcum,</hi> on our Left Hand, as we come downwards, we ſee the famous Caſtle of <hi>Lovenſtein.</hi> It is a very ſolitary Place, <note place="margin">Loven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein.</note> and has no other Building <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear it. It ſtands on a ſmall point of Land, between two great Rivers. This Caſtle is the Place where the States confine any conſiderable Perſons who are condemn'd to be Priſoners for Life. At this narrow point of Land the <hi>Maeſe</hi> comes into the Chanel, call'd the <hi>Wael;</hi> and from this Place the united Streams were anciently call'd the <hi>Merwe,</hi> down to <hi>Ulaarding,</hi> which is below <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and almoſt at the Sea; but now the Name of the <hi>Maeſe</hi> prevails in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Uſe.</p>
               <p>When we were near <hi>Gorcum,</hi> we took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that large Track of Ground which ſuffer'd by an Inundation the laſt Winter, in <note place="margin">Innunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> froſty Weather, in which ſome People and many Cattle were drown'd. The Water of the <hi>Maeſe</hi> being ſwell'd by a Bank of Ice which
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:94187:214"/> clogg'd the River, it run over the Dyke on the right ſide, a little above <hi>Gorcum,</hi> at two Places, and run over a great Compaſs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try within, for with running over the Dyke it wore it away. It was ſome time before the Miſchief could be cured by clearing the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the River, and a dangerous Work to go about it; but the City of <hi>Gorcum</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to adventure the Danger of it, to ſave themſelves from the Inundation which would ſoon have been at leaſt in all their lower Rooms. The Occaſion of the ſtopping of the broken Ice, at this Place, ſeems to have been an Iſland which lies here in the middle of the River, a good ſpot of which appear'd above the Water cover'd with Graſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that, at this time, the River was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſwell'd. The Breaches of the Dyke ſtill remain'd when we came by, which was at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> and the Water ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to lie all over the Country; ſo that of Neceſſity the Ground muſt be loſt for this Year, and I cannot tell whether or no it will ever be recover'd.</p>
               <p>A little below this, a great deal was loſt, long ſince, by an Innundation near <hi>Dort,</hi> which is not recover'd to this Day. When we came near <hi>Dort,</hi> between ſeveral little Plats of Ground which have nothing on them but Graſs, we ſaw on the Left Hand of us that broad Water call'd <hi>Den Bies Bos,</hi> which is all of it an old Inundation, which happen'd in the Year 1421, at a time, I ſuppoſe, of a great Land-Flood meeting with a Spring-tide, and that drove in from the Sea, perhaps, with
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:94187:214"/> a high weſterly Wind; which things concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, are very dangerous to theſe Countries. The <hi>Wael</hi> and the <hi>Maeſe</hi> ſwell'd to that degree, that they broke in upon this Country, between <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and drowned Seventy Populous Villages, and in them more than an Hundred thouſand Perſons. The Tradition of the Country ſays, there was no Perſon ſav'd, but a Child in a Cradle, with a Cat; and that the Cat help'd to ſave the Child, by flying from one ſide to the other of the Cradle, as the Waves threatned to overturn it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of thoſe Plats of Ground, foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, there ſtands a piece of a tall Brick Wall, the Remains of a great Houſe which formerly ſtood there. Some of the Lands ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to <hi>Dort</hi> have been ſince recover'd, but far the greateſt part remain ſtill under Water.</p>
               <p>We reach'd but to <hi>Dort</hi> this Day, but we came time enough to get in, and lodg'd in the City. At ſix a Clock next Morning we ſet Sail again; it was almoſt a Calm. The breath of Wind that did move, was againſt us. We advanced ſo ſlowly, that we fear'd we ſhould make a Day of this Paſſage; therefore, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, we went into a Boat, with Oars, which call'd on purpoſe at ours, and at other Ships, for ſuch Paſſengers as were in haſt. We gave them ſix Stivers each Perſon for our Paſſage, were about an Hour and half in their Boat, and got to <hi>Rotterdam</hi> by ten a Clock, ſome Hours before our Ship could arrive; ſo I had by that time diſpatc'd ſome Buſineſs I had to do, and was ready to return to the <hi>Hague</hi> the ſame Day. We were very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94187:215"/> to Almighty God, as we had Reaſon, for the favourable Aſſiſtance and Protection of his Good Providence, through this Journey; which was ſuch, that we were never ſo much as in fear of being robb'd, or abus'd by Thieves, in a Journey of ſeveral Hundred Miles. And though we ſometimes apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſeveral other Dangers, yet we eſcap'd them all, without ſuffering any unlucky Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
